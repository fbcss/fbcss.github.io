should read."], ["00:54", " But at the end of the movie, The Fellowship of the Ring was fractured, the main characters"], ["00:59", " were killed, orcs in evil, were winning, Frodo and his friends

were different, when will you restore the Kingdom of Israel?"], ["11:25", " They were thinking about a time in the Old Testament when the Nation of Israel was not divided"], ["11:30", " into two

You know, they have such an attention to detail. They even want the street outside of their establishment to be clean, which means this lady was cleaning up other people's messes, cigarette butts, the people had thrown there."], ["01:38", " Man, they smoked a lot of Europe, I'm just saying. It was smoke break all the time. And, you know, trash that would blow, you know, from the night before. Not if it was that businesses trash, certainly not that ladies trash, but nevertheless, she came out every morning to clean up someone else's mess."], ["01:56", " And I noticed that phenomena, different businesses, people would come out in the morning and they would kind of hose down and sweep up in front of the business.

After all, you know, the sidewalk is not, or the street is not theirs, they don't own that. So, why would they pick it up? It's someone else's mess."], ["02:24", " Everybody had to clean someone else's mess. Why would you do that?"], ["02:30", " You know, my dad, by the way, I want to say this about my father, he has retired in 2021, and it's just been in the community and up there in Woodstock and Brunswick, Carlton County.

Just a curiosity. How long did they have to wait in Jerusalem? It was actually 10 days."], ["06:58", " How do I know that? Because there's 50 days between the Jewish festival of first fruits, where Jesus rose from the dead, and the 50 days between that and the Jewish celebration of Pentecost, and we know the Holy Spirit comes on Pentecost."], ["07:14", " So Jesus was with his disciples, according to Luke 40 days after he rose from the dead before he was ascended up into heaven."], ["07:24", " So he told them, \"Wait in Jerusalem until the promise comes.\" He was within 40 days.

There is broken unity, the offense of the friends, the disciples, the followers of Jesus, and their reputation as a group."], ["09:58", " It's a big mess. How do they make sense of this? I think this is a scenario that many can relate to."], ["10:06", " We know there are people in here who are feeling the pain of broken relationships, very messy situations because of hurt and offense and even feeling betrayed."], ["10:19", " Someone did something to you and it's just made a big mess for you.

How do we make sense of it?"], ["10:35", " Well, what I saw here is Peter turns the group's attention to the Word of the Lord. Look at verse number 16."], ["10:43", " So Peter stood up in the midst of disciples, verse 15, and he said, \"Man and brethren, this scripture has been fulfilled that the Holy Spirit spoke for the multi-David concerning Judas.\""], ["10:56", " And then verse number 20, he quotes the scripture. It's written in the book of Psalms, \"Let His dwelling be desolate, let no one live in it, and let another take His office.\""], ["11:08", " So Peter's quoting the Old Testament, and we're going to check out these passages from the Psalms in just a moment."], ["11:14", " But I did not want to miss the opportunity to stress the importance of finding the answers to all of life's challenges in the Word of God."], ["11:25", " We live in a world, we are living in a time when our culture is fragmented.

Many people do not."], ["11:48", " Consequently, when the storm of life crashes down on them, when chaos and conflict assaults them, they have feelings, they have all these opinions and all these emotions of fear and anger, but where can they go to find the right answer?"], ["12:01", " Where can they go for the truth?

And then finally the older boys would jump off and they would grab a hole of him and they would knock him to the ground and they would kick him around and he'd be laying their whimpering and screaming and then they let him up and he'd start gapping all over again with this empty threats."], ["13:13", " So that's kind of what's going on here, but these kings of the earth, unlike Nikki, who was doing it jokingly and he was going to get his hat handed to him, these nations, they think they can actually do something against the Messiah against God's plans."], ["13:30", " And the author of Psalms chapter 2, David, he saw that, he literally experienced that in his days when he would take on these nations like the Philistines.

So they see Psalms chapter 2 being fulfilled before their very eyes as they watch the religious leaders and Herod and Pontius Pilate all plotted against Jesus."], ["16:00", " And in doing so, they're plotting not just against the followers of Jesus or some guy from Nazareth, they are raging and they are railing up against God himself."], ["16:10", " Look at verse number 27. \"For truly against your holy servant Jesus whom you anointed, both Herod, Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together to do whatever your hand, your purpose, determined to be done.\""], ["16:30", " So he says there, your holy servant, God who you anointed, that stresses that the raging and the plotting, the stand is being taken against God himself."], ["16:41", " Now, of course, little did they know that the crucifixion of Jesus was exactly God's plan from the very start as which the disciples point out to do whatever whose hand God's hand, verse 28, God's hand, your purpose determined to be done."], ["16:59", " It was his plan and purpose for Jesus to be crucified."], ["17:03", " But here's a question as I was thinking about this whole concept of the raging and plotting and taking a stand against God."], ["17:12", " How arrogant do you have to be to plot and rage and take a stand against God?

clothes, pants, you know, shorts and"], ["00:48", " all that, but mostly that's what my wardrobe was."], ["00:50", " On Sundays, of course I had Sunday clothes, buttoned down shirts, dress pants, dress shoes,"], ["00:55", " high sweaters, I didn't wear any of that school, that was just only for church."], ["01:00", " Now, when I came down here to Washington Bible College, Atlanta, their school

that's what I did."], ["01:22", " I wore my church clothes and that was fine, according to the dress code, but most of the American"], ["01:28", " kids, they had cargo pants, some cool pockets and the

You"], ["02:41", " pick up some new clothes here and there, clearance racks, you know, I mean Christmas"], ["02:45", " and birthdays, you get some stuff and in college, you get to beg, borrow and steal clothes"], ["02:49", " off your roommate or a buddy.

Peter warns us of destruction, of the judgment of God"], ["06:18", " upon those who reject truth and follow after lies. But he gives us examples. He gives"], ["06:24", " us evidence to back up his assertions. So I said, if you want to know the details, you've"], ["06:30", " got to come back. And apparently you did. So you're interested to find out these examples."], ["06:36", " So chapter two, verse number four. Here's Peter's examples to back up the threat of destruction."], ["06:44", " He says, for if God did not spare the angels who sin, but cast them down to hell and"], ["06:50", " delivered them into the chains of darkness to re-reserve for judgment. And he did not"], ["06:55", " spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness"], ["07:00", " bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly and turning the cities of Sodom and"], ["07:07", " Gomorrah into ashes, condemning them to destruction, making them an example to those who"], ["07:13", " afterwards would live on godly and delivered righteous lot who was oppressed by the"], ["07:18", " filthy conduct of their wicked, of the wicked, for that righteous man dwelling among them"], ["07:24", " tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds."], ["07:29", " Then the Lord knows how to deliver the godly at a temptation and to reserve the unjust"], ["07:36", " under punishment for the day of judgment and especially those who walk according to the flesh"], ["07:43", " and the lust of unclenliness and despise authorities. So Peter gives us a history lesson"], ["07:50", " to back up his claims the god will bring judgment. Three examples, the angels who sinned,"], ["07:58", " the ancient world destroyed by the flood and Sodom and Gomorrah. Three of the biggest"], ["08:03", " examples from Genesis, the three that shocked and amazed people for generations. Also,"], ["08:11", " the three events recorded in the Bible that many people have a hard time accepting as"], ["08:17", " true. They seem so extreme and so wild. That's like nothing we've ever witnessed. And"], ["08:24", " you want to know why that is? Because these judgments were so effective. You only had"], ["08:31", " to see it once. Thereafter, the threatening of judgment was more than enough to keep the"], ["08:39", " most of humanity away from completely going evil. When I was in school, there were teachers"], ["08:48", " who we'd act up in their classes all day long because they never did anything to stop us."], ["08:56", " One math teacher we had, he was always drunk or dealing with a hangover and he did not"], ["09:03", " care what we did. It seemed like there was no line. He had no line for us to cross and"], ["09:10", " we spent the entire year trying to see if we could find the line. And the whole time we"], ["09:17", " were in his class, we were testing to see what can we get away with? It was a third story"], ["09:22", " window. So we would just throw paper and textbooks and whatever junk out the window just"], ["09:29", " to see. We'd catch his attention and we would just mess up our desk and mess up our chairs"], ["09:35", " and just break the things. And one guy took her to knife and he cut all of the drapes"], ["09:41", " into little strips and another fella pulled out a lighter and he lit his desk on fire."], ["09:47", " And it was a game we played to see if we'd even get his attention. And rarely he barely"], ["09:58", " look up at us."], ["10:01", " Meanwhile, we had other teachers who we did not are a peep in their classes. Mrs. Bryant"], ["10:08", " was an old lady with a bamboo stick. She never smiled and she was always on the edge of"], ["10:16", " snapping and she heard a noise. She turned around and bangs! She hit the desk right in front"], ["10:21", " of you and scared the devil right out of you. Teachers were permitted to strap us on the"], ["10:27", " hand or have us stand up and give us some swaths on the hind end. And there were teachers"], ["10:34", " who were notorious for strapping, but Mrs. Bryant was in a leak up her own. She was just"], ["10:40", " looking for an excuse to beat a child's butt. So you never heard anyone speak, chew a"], ["10:50", " gum, pass a note, drop a pencil. Look sideways. Nobody ever acted up at Mrs. Bryant's"], ["11:02", " class. In math class, we lit desk on fire. Same kids, different results because we'd seen"], ["11:10", " the punishment. Mrs. Bryant would deliver everyone new. Don't test her. You'll suffer."], ["11:17", " My point is, the things that we study today, God's punishment was so severe after it happened."], ["11:24", " Most people got the message. God made his point. Most people recognize the wrath of God"], ["11:29", " as a real thing. We better keep ourselves and we better keep our communities in check"], ["11:34", " or else. So yes, we have never seen God's severe wrath like these three examples because"], ["11:44", " things haven't gotten that bad. Yet, first time God's wrath was severe. We see a verse"], ["11:52", " number four. Peter says, \"The angels themselves who sinned, cast down to hell, delivered"], ["11:59", " into the chains of darkness to be reserved for judgment.\" Wow, what do they do? Well, Peter"], ["12:05", " doesn't elaborate on that. The fact that he doesn't elaborate seems to indicate that"], ["12:10", " his audience already knows what he's talking about, so he doesn't go into details. Jude"], ["12:14", " likewise references this event with the angels in much the same way. A Jude-like Peter"], ["12:20", " was warning the church about ungodly people pretending to be out of the faith, but they're"], ["12:25", " not believers and they have evil intentions. Turn over a couple pages to your, this way,"], ["12:32", " towards Revelation. It's like two books over Jude, chapter one, because there's only one chapter,"], ["12:37", " verse number four. And we read, \" Certain men have crept in on notice too long ago were marked"], ["12:46", " out for this condemnation, ungodly men who turned the grace of our God into lewdness"], ["12:51", " and denied the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.\" But I want to remind you, though"], ["12:59", " you once knew this, that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward"], ["13:06", " destroyed those who did not believe. And the angels who did not keep their proper domain,"], ["13:11", " left their own abode, he has reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness for the judgment"], ["13:16", " of the great day, as Sodom and Gomorrah. And the cities around them in the similar manner"], ["13:24", " to these having given themselves over to sexual immorality of God after strange flesh are"], ["13:29", " set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. So just like Peter, Jude"], ["13:39", " uses two of the same examples of God's judgment to warn the church to warn us of what happens"], ["13:46", " when people fall away from the faith. These angels, Peter says, \"Who did not keep their"], ["13:51", " proper domain but left their abode are now in chains held captive.\" Because whatever"], ["13:59", " they did, and Peter or Jude don't tell us specifically what sin that angels did other"], ["14:05", " than Jude says, \"Well, they didn't keep their proper domain.\" So Jude's audience, like"], ["14:09", " Peter's audience, seems to know what these authors are referring to. Apparently, everybody"], ["14:15", " knew what those angels did. Do you know what those angels did? Turn to Genesis, chapter"], ["14:22", " six. Let's go right back to the source material. The very beginning, Genesis chapter"], ["14:28", " six verses one through eight. We pick it up here. It came to pass. When men began to multiply"], ["14:44", " on the face of the earth, the daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw the daughters"], ["14:49", " of men that they were beautiful, and they took wise for themselves of all whom they"], ["14:54", " chose. And the Lord said, \"My spirit will not strive with man forever, for he is indeed"], ["14:59", " flesh. It is day shall be 120 years.\" There were giants on the earth in those days, and"], ["15:04", " also after when the sons of God came into the daughters of men, and they bore children"], ["15:10", " to them. They were the mighty men who were old, behold, men of renown. The Lord saw the"], ["15:16", " wickedness of man was great on the earth and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart"], ["15:21", " was only evil continually, and the Lord was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and"], ["15:26", " he was grieved in his heart. So the Lord said, \"I will destroy man whom I have created"], ["15:32", " from the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing, birds of the air. I am sorry"], ["15:37", " that I made them.\" But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord."], ["15:44", " So taking that at face value, it means angels somehow had sexual relations with human"], ["15:49", " women and spawned a hybrid offspring. This is what Jude means when he says the angels"], ["15:55", " did not keep their proper domain. The offspring of these angels and human women was"], ["16:01", " a race of mighty men called the Nephilim or called the giants, and these giants were very"], ["16:10", " evil and corrupted the entire world, and all of humanity became very evil. In the, there's"], ["16:17", " an ancient book that was written in around 300 BC called the Book of Enoch, and it gives"], ["16:23", " much greater detail about these angels and all that they did. So the Book of Enoch tells"], ["16:28", " us the oral traditions that the Israelites learned and passed down about these fallen angels."], ["16:35", " So according to the Book of Enoch, 200 angels conspired to come down to earth, live with humans,"], ["16:40", " marry the women, and teach forbidden knowledge. Their offspring, the Nephilim were also called"], ["16:45", " giants, were powerful and violent, and their appetites were insatiable, they killed, and"], ["16:50", " they plundered to such an extent that most of humanity was corrupted by their bloodline."], ["16:56", " So the Book of Enoch is not included in the Jewish scriptures. It is not part of the"], ["17:00", " Old Testament, so we don't view its details as the inspired word of God, but what the Book"], ["17:06", " of Enoch does, it provides us the understanding of what Peter and Jude's audiences learned"], ["17:14", " or understood the interpretations of Genesis 6 to be. The Book of Enoch fills in a narrative,"], ["17:21", " but Genesis 6 alone gives us the facts, gives us alone the facts that the angels left"], ["17:26", " their domain, cohabitated with the humans, and their offspring corrupted the world. Peter"], ["17:31", " and Jude revealed to us that the angels who did this were severely punished, locked away"], ["17:38", " in an abyss, held in chains of darkness, till the great judgment. \"That's just crazy. I've"], ["17:44", " never heard such a thing. That's got to be a myth.\" This is true, we don't see angels"], ["17:50", " meeting with humans anymore. I wonder why? Could it be that the rest of the angels saw"], ["17:56", " how severe God's wrath was, and concluded, \"Ooh, I ain't worth it.\" Let's remain in"], ["18:02", " our proper domain and not try to procreate with humans. It's only going to get us destroyed,"], ["18:09", " because after all, that is Peter's point. That's the point he's trying to make. And"], ["18:14", " the destruction was not just on the angels. In the same chapter of Genesis, chapter 6,"], ["18:20", " he connects the story of the angels, spawning the Nephilim hybrid race to the flood of Noah,"], ["18:27", " which is Peter's second example. In Peter chapter 2, verse 5, he said, \"And did not spare"], ["18:35", " the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing"], ["18:40", " in the flood on the world of the ungodly.\" So wicked, so corrupt, was the entire population"], ["18:48", " of the earth that only Noah was determined to be righteous. Genesis chapter 6, verse 5 through"], ["18:55", " 8, \"The Lord saw the wickedness of man was great, the intent of the thoughts of his heart"], ["18:59", " was only continual continually. The Lord was sorry that he made man on the earth, it grieved"], ["19:05", " his heart.\" So the Lord said, \"I'm going to destroy man whom I have created from the face"], ["19:10", " of the earth, man and be scraping things, birds of the air, I'm sorry I made them, but"], ["19:17", " Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.\" Since everyone was evil, God sent the flood"], ["19:23", " to destroy all life with the exception of Noah and his eight family members and the animals"], ["19:30", " that got on the ark. And Peter's point is these false teachers, their disobedience and unclenliness"], ["19:38", " is only going to result in destruction. So keep the false teachers out of the church."], ["19:44", " And then he gives one last example of destruction, Peter quotes, and so does Jude, Sodom"], ["19:50", " and Gomorrah. These cities were in the time of Abraham and like the pre-flood civilization,"], ["19:58", " these cities were totally corrupted. Turn to Genesis chapter 19. Let's read the story of"], ["20:05", " Sodom and Gomorrah. All right, chapter 19, Genesis. Now the two angels came to Sodom"], ["20:16", " in the evening. Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose up, met"], ["20:21", " them, bowed himself with his face towards the ground and he said, \"Here now, my Lord's"], ["20:25", " please turn into your servant's house and spend the night, wash your feet and then you"], ["20:30", " can rise up early and go on your way.\" And they said, \"Nah, we'll spend the night in"], ["20:37", " the open square.\" But Lot insisted strongly so they turned into him and entered his house."], ["20:46", " Then he made them a feast and baked on leaven bread and they ate. Now before they laid"], ["20:51", " down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, old and young, all the people from every"], ["20:58", " quarter surrounded the house and they called to Lot and said, \"Where's the man who"], ["21:02", " came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can know them currently.\" Lot went out"], ["21:10", " to them through the doorway, shut the door behind and he said, \"Please, my brother, do not"], ["21:14", " do so wickedly. See, now I have two daughters who have not known man. Please let them"], ["21:21", " bring them out to you and you may do with them as you wish, only do nothing to these"], ["21:28", " men, since this is the reason they have come under the shadow of my roof.\" And they"], ["21:32", " said, \"Stand back.\" Then they said, \"This one, he came to stay here and he keeps acting"], ["21:39", " as a judge. Now we will deal worse with you than with them.\" So they pressed hard against"], ["21:44", " the man lot. They came near to break down the door. But the men, the angels reached out"], ["21:49", " their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them and shut the door. And then they"], ["21:53", " struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness. Well, small and great,"], ["21:58", " so that it became weary trying to find the door. So the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah is that"], ["22:05", " they were so sexually deviant that the entire city would want to pray on helpless travelers."], ["22:13", " Two male travelers weren't safe in that city after nightfall. Lot, the nephew of Abraham"], ["22:22", " is the only righteous person in the city and he tried to protect these angels who are disguised"], ["22:27", " as guys traveling. He insisted that they stay in his house for the night and all the men"], ["22:34", " in the evening showed up at Lost Door demanding the travelers be brought out so they could"], ["22:39", " violate them. The men wanted to violate these other men. But the angels blinded the people"], ["22:46", " of the city and then they compelled Lot in his family to leave because God is going to"], ["22:51", " destroy this wicked culture. And God does. He rains down fire and brimstone and destroys"], ["22:57", " everyone in those cities. So Sodom is comparable to the days of Noah where the entire"], ["23:04", " city is given over to perversion and violence. Not the whole world at that time, just for"], ["23:11", " whatever reason, these two cities was a concentration of immorality. So there's your three"], ["23:17", " examples in the background, the history, three testimonies of God's judgment and destruction"], ["23:23", " that comes when people give themselves over to filthy conduct and lawless deeds. And"], ["23:28", " while yes, it is true that all people are sinners and there has been many horrible examples"], ["23:37", " of cruelty and injustice. And God this behavior in every in all culture, the world over"], ["23:44", " nevertheless, it is never gotten to the extent of what humanity was like before the flood"], ["23:50", " or how deviant the entire population of Sodom and Gomorrah was. As perverted as America"], ["23:57", " is in 2025, we're not as perverted as they were in Sodom and Gomorrah. So yay. So we never"], ["24:06", " seen this in our time, this level of judgments. Those events have a long ago and faraway"], ["24:14", " and some people speculate, well since we don't see that level of judgment and wrath from"], ["24:17", " God, probably that's not true. That's just all made up. You know, that's just a scare tactic."], ["24:25", " That doesn't happen in real life. And why do you suppose that is? Because as bad as things"], ["24:33", " get, there is still some element, some percentage of the population that will exercise"], ["24:42", " some level of restraint. There is a percentage of the population that does fear God, that"], ["24:48", " can spot the patterns, can connect the dots and see that wickedness leads to destruction."], ["24:54", " Godless living leads to death, immorality leads to poverty and shame and ruin. Meanwhile,"], ["24:59", " there is another way to live that leads to blessings and peace. And since there is enough"], ["25:05", " percentage of the population that will strive to live good, even though we're not perfect,"], ["25:10", " we are humble and repentant and faithful enough that it promotes God to be patient. And"], ["25:18", " I'm not just making that up. Just pull that out of my hat. This is literally what God said"], ["25:26", " to Abraham before the angels went down to destroy Sodom. Abraham advocates for mercy"], ["25:32", " for those cities. Go to Genesis chapter 18. Let me read to you this interesting discussion,"], ["25:39", " God has with Abraham. This is Genesis 18, picking it up at verse 20. And the Lord said,"], ["25:49", " \"Because of the O cry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grave,"], ["25:56", " I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the O cry against it that"], ["26:03", " has come up to me in it. And if not, I will know.\" So the men turned away from there and went"], ["26:10", " towards Sodom. So that's the two angels, okay? But Abraham stood before the Lord."], ["26:14", " Abraham came near and said, \"Would you also destroy the righteous with the wicked?\""], ["26:21", " Suppose there's 50 righteous within the city. Would you destroy the place and not spare it"], ["26:28", " for the 50 righteous that are in it? Fire be it from you to do such a thing as this,"], ["26:33", " to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked. Fire be it"], ["26:37", " from you. Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?\" And the Lord said, \"If I find in Sodom 50"], ["26:48", " righteous within the city, I will spare all the place for their sakes.\" Abraham answered and said,"], ["26:57", " \"Indeed now I who am but dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord.\""], ["27:04", " Suppose there were five less than 50 righteous. Would you destroy the city for a lack of five?"], ["27:10", " So he said, \"If there are 45, I will not destroy it.\" And he spoke to him again and said,"], ["27:16", " \"Suppose there's 40 found there.\" And he said, \"I won't destroy it for the sake of 40.\""], ["27:22", " And then he said, \"Look, let the Lord be angry and I will speak. Suppose 30 should be found there.\""], ["27:28", " He said, \"I won't destroy it if I find 30 there.\" And he said, \"Indeed, now the man,"], ["27:31", " this guy, he should be in contracts, right? Like this guy can negotiate.\" Abraham says, \"verse 31.\""], ["27:37", " \"Indeed now I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord. Suppose 20 be found there.\""], ["27:41", " And he said, \"I won't destroy it for the sake of 20.\" And he said, \"Let not the Lord be angry. I'll speak"], ["27:46", " one more time. Just one more time. Suppose 10 be found.\" And he said, \"I will not destroy it for the sake of"], ["27:52", " 10.\" So the Lord went his way as soon as he was finished speaking with Abraham. Abraham returned to his"], ["27:59", " place. Very insightful interaction. Through what we learn, there is a level of abomination that"], ["28:08", " God will not tolerate. However, if there is a percentage of the population that's righteous,"], ["28:14", " a very small fraction for their sake, he would withhold judgments. And then we remember the words"], ["28:23", " of the Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew chapter 5. He tells his followers, \"You are the salt of the earth,"], ["28:32", " but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned?\" And then it's not good"], ["28:38", " for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled under the foot of man. \"You are the light of the world.\""], ["28:44", " A city set on a hill cannot be hidden nor does the light of a lamp be put under a basket,"], ["28:49", " but on a lamp stand to give light to all who are in the house.

Peter warns us of destruction, of the judgment"], ["29:59", " of God upon those who reject truth and follow after lies, and he gives us the examples as the"], ["30:05", " evidence to back up his assertions. And for the longest times, those three examples,"], ["30:10", " Sodom and Gomorrah, the flood, the angels were very effective warnings.

They don't believe Sodom was a real place"], ["30:26", " or God would ever be so vengeful and bring destruction on people. Look at Peter's description of"], ["30:33", " folks. Verse number 10, chapter 2, verse 10. Actually pick it up in verse 9. Then the Lord knows"], ["30:40", " how to deliver Godly at a temptation and reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment."], ["30:45", " And especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanliness and despise"], ["30:51", " authority.

She's managed to do almost. There's a catch. Let's pick up the story here in chapter 3."], ["08:07", " Remember that Ruth went to uncover Boaz's feet and presented herself in need of a kinsman redeemer"], ["08:14", " asked Boaz to marry her and he said, so chapter 3 verse number 10, he said to her, \"Don't touch"], ["08:22", " my feet.\" No, he said, \"Blest are you of the Lord my daughter. You have shown more kindness"], ["08:26", " at the end than at the beginning in that you did not go after the young man, whether poor"], ["08:30", " or rich. Now my daughter do not fear. I will do for you all that is requested for all the people"], ["08:37", " of my town know you are a virtuous woman.\" All right, so that's great. But wait, there's a catch"], ["08:46", " for 21st 12.

There's a"], ["09:51", " illegal obligation. The closest relative has first dips. So Boaz is going to honor that and Boaz is"], ["09:59", " going to abide by the laws of God over and above any emotional entanglement that he might feel for"], ["10:06", " Ruth.

So many"], ["10:12", " people, so many times, people allow emotional entanglements to govern their life's decisions over and"], ["10:18", " above the Word of God. Because of a feeling lonely or a zeal to find love, people who ignore what"], ["10:24", " scripture says about getting into our relationship with someone who's an unbeliever or maybe with"], ["10:29", " a person who is spiritually immature, being unequally yoked is the phrase that Jesus used."], ["10:34", " Not looking for virtuous, but rather someone who meet my need, my emotional, my physical needs."], ["10:41", " And then once we are married, we deal with the same issue.

I would like to be the Kingsbury Demon and marry you Ruth,"], ["10:56", " but technically there's someone in line ahead of me. So we will follow the laws and see if he"], ["11:01", " will perform the duty. What do you think of that strategy? If you were Ruth and you were kind of"], ["11:06", " wanting Boaz, would you be happy with that law? If you were Boaz and you really wanted Ruth,"], ["11:12", " would you be happy with that process? Seems like obedience and duty is first and happiness has to"], ["11:20", " wait. Seems to me like it's a step of faith is required. An act of obedience is prioritized over"], ["11:28", " and above emotions. Interesting because Jesus says in John chapter 15, \"If you keep my commandments,"], ["11:37", " you will abide in my love just as I have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love."], ["11:42", " These things I've spoken to you that my joy will remain with you and that your joy may be full."], ["11:54", " Our joy is full when we keep his commandments and we love one another.

If you know these things,"], ["12:31", " blessed are you if you do them. Our joy is complete. Our blessings are dependent upon us on a"], ["12:38", " serving God by loving others, by serving one another. Ruth is serving Naomi and Bo has a serving"], ["12:47", " Ruth and both are serving God by complying with his commandments. But as always, a step of faith"], ["12:52", " is required because it's scary. Remember Jesus when he was in the Garden of Gethsemane? He didn't"], ["13:00", " feel like going to the cross. Remember Moses? He didn't feel like going to talk to Pharaoh,"], ["13:07", " and Daniel didn't feel like getting thrown in the lines then, and Queen Esther, she didn't feel"], ["13:11", " like going before the King of Persia. In all these examples and many more, we see a step of faith"], ["13:16", " is often required, someone who pushed beyond their personal preferences, stepping out of their comfort"], ["13:23", " zone, complying with the will of God, Spirit lead me when my trust is with those borders."], ["13:27", " Let me walk upon the waters, whatever you will call me.

We're going to read verses 1 through 9"], ["00:36", " and then make some observations. So, Ruth chapter 3, verse 1, Naomi, her mother-in-law said to"], ["00:41", " her, \"My daughter shall I not seek security for you that it may be well with you.\" Now,"], ["00:47", " Bo-es, who's young women you were with, is he not our relative? In fact, he is winnowing"], ["00:54", " barley tonight at the threshing floor, therefore, wash yourself, anoint yourself, put"], ["01:01", " on your best garment and go down to the threshing floor, but do not make yourself known"], ["01:06", " to the man until he's finished eating and drinking. Then it shall be. When he lies down,"], ["01:12", " you notice a place where he lies, you shall go in uncovers feet, lie down, and he will tell"], ["01:18", " you what you should do. And she said to her, \"All that you say to me, I will do.\" So,"], ["01:24", " she went down to the threshing floor, did, according to all that her mother-in-law instructed"], ["01:28", " her. And after Bo-es had eaten and drunk, and his heart was cheerful, he went to lie"], ["01:32", " down at the end of the heap of grain, and she came softly and covered his feet, lay"], ["01:39", " down. Now, it happened at midnight that the man was startled, and he turned himself, and"], ["01:44", " there was a woman laying in his feet, he said, \"Who are you?\" And she answered, \"I'm"], ["01:48", " Ruth, you're made servant. Take your made servant under your wing for you are a close"], ["01:54", " relative.\" Mm, weird. What's going on here? When Eliana and I first got married, I had this"], ["02:00", " job in Canada, so she agreed, she would move to Canada, but she said, \"Family is really"], ["02:05", " important to me, so we have to get down to see my family at least once a year.\" And"], ["02:09", " she said, \"Okay, we'll make that a priority.\" Now, the challenge with that was two things."], ["02:14", " I wasn't making a lot of money, and it was, you know, 21-hour drive to get down to Virginia."], ["02:21", " So, in order to see family, we either had to buy some plane tickets, or we had to do"], ["02:25", " a three-day drive. We chose the drive because it was cheaper than buying three to four plane"], ["02:31", " tickets. And here's why. We started out driving five hours from Nova Scotia to the border"], ["02:37", " of New Brunswick in Maine, where my parents live. That was a five-hour trip, and we would"], ["02:43", " just break for the night there, and my parents would let us spend the night. They were"], ["02:47", " so happy because we got to visit Grandkids at that time. They feed us supper, they'd"], ["02:52", " let us stay for free, and then we get breakfast in the morning. My dad would take my car"], ["02:59", " keys and run to the gas station and take my car up, and then mom would give us a lunch"], ["03:04", " for the road. So, basically, our first day of travel did not cost us anything. Then we"], ["03:10", " would drive probably like Connecticut. It might have been a mystic Connecticut. That was"], ["03:15", " a place we'd like to stop in Connecticut. And then the next day, we would finish up the"], ["03:20", " drive to Virginia. And once we got to Virginia, we would stay, of course, with Eliana's"], ["03:25", " family. And just like my parents, her parents would cover us. They would take us out to"], ["03:30", " eat, and they would pay the bill. They would get tickets to King's Dominion, and insist"], ["03:35", " on covering everything. So, the main cost of our vacations was basically six days of driving"], ["03:41", " down and back, and some shopping. But that was still a substantial cost to us at that"], ["03:49", " time, because we were living paycheck to paycheck. If we managed to get a little bit of"], ["03:54", " money saved, generally a car repair would come along and just wipe it all up. So, this"], ["03:59", " particular year, it was earlier in our marriage, things were tight, of course, because"], ["04:03", " that's the way we live. And we still decided we're going to take two weeks and go to Virginia."], ["04:08", " Now, while we were down here, Eliana's father was plumbing company. He worked for Woodbridge"], ["04:15", " plumbing over Woodbridge, and they were having this special anniversary dinner. The company"], ["04:21", " had done very well, and the boss wanted to celebrate with all of his employees. He had"], ["04:25", " a big dinner, and then he gave, surprising to them, everybody got a bonus. And for every"], ["04:31", " year that somebody worked with the company, he gave them a $100 per year. They worked."], ["04:36", " So Julio, he worked 10 to 12 years for them, and he got this substantial bonus. Now, this"], ["04:41", " is back in the '90s when $100 was still worth something, right? That was big money back"], ["04:46", " in the '90s. So, all the employees were very shocked and they were very grateful to get"], ["04:50", " that bonus, and we were very happy for Julio. Well, when vacation was over, and we were"], ["04:55", " packing to leave, Julio comes up, and he gives me $800. A big chunk of his bonus, and"], ["05:02", " he was so happy that we brought the boys and spent the vacation with them, and that basically"], ["05:07", " covered the cost of that trip getting down there. So, I've been blessed with parents and"], ["05:13", " within laws who, when we were struggling, were all too happy to cover us. It's a blessing,"], ["05:21", " and it molded and shaped my understanding of what a parent is supposed to do and what"], ["05:26", " family does for one another. When we come to chapter 3, we see Naomi has that same"], ["05:32", " attitude here in verse 1. She says, \"My daughter, shall I not seek security for you"], ["05:38", " that it may be well with you.\" Now, other translations where it says security here in"], ["05:44", " the New King James, others will say what? What do you, it says? Find rest. Some of you"], ["05:49", " that says find rest for you. The Hebrew word here is manoach. When we say rest, we think,"], ["05:57", " you know, sleeping or just kind of having some downtime. Security, the English word, better"], ["06:04", " communicates what that Hebrew word manoach is trying to communicate because it does mean"], ["06:08", " rest. Manoach means taking a break from work. Like, after the seven days of creation,"], ["06:13", " God rested on the seventh and the Sabbath rest was a time when you took a break from work,"], ["06:20", " right? Largest out to rejuvenate, but there's more depth to manoach than is right in that"], ["06:27", " idea of just taking a break. It described when the nation of Israel inhabited the Promised"], ["06:33", " Land in Deuteronomy chapter 12, it says, \"For as yet you have not come to the rest"], ["06:40", " and the inheritance which the Lord God has given you, but when you cross over the Jordan"], ["06:44", " and dwell in the land which the Lord God has given you to inherit, and he gives you what?\""], ["06:51", " Rest from your enemies round of boat so that you will dwell safely. So rest in the Promised"], ["06:56", " Land is associated with Israelites having relief from their enemies dwelling securely."], ["07:03", " Rest from wanting, so from struggling to survive, the land flowed with milk and honey"], ["07:10", " and the land was going to provide for them. Often when we are struggling to make ends meet,"], ["07:15", " we think if I could just get a better job or I could get this car paid off, then I could"], ["07:20", " get a break. We'll say that, right? We say that word. If I could just get a break, I could"], ["07:24", " save up and then we could have some financial security. The lands, the Promised Land was"], ["07:32", " financial security taking a level to stress off the people. So Naomi is wanting to take"], ["07:38", " this burden of struggle to survive off of Ruth, and she has a plan. She says, \"Should I"], ["07:44", " not find security for you that will be well with you?\" Then her next question, Boaz,"], ["07:52", " whose young woman you are with, is he not our relative? So I noticed that in this book,"], ["08:00", " right here in these two verses, and I went back and looked at the previous chapters,"], ["08:04", " much of Naomi's dialogue is in the form of questions. Jewish folks are known for asking"], ["08:10", " questions and answering questions with questions. Have you noticed that? The Pharisees"], ["08:14", " would come and ask Jesus a question, and they were generally strategies to test his"], ["08:18", " interpretation of the law and hope to trap him. Is it lawful to pay taxes? Is it lawful"], ["08:24", " for a man to divorce his wife? Teacher, what's the greatest commandment in the law? One"], ["08:29", " time they asked him, \"But who's authority are you doing miracles, Jesus?\" And he responded"], ["08:33", " by answering their question with a question. I'll ask you a question. Whose baptism was"], ["08:39", " John from? Was it from heaven or from men? So Jesus, likewise, was good at answering questions"], ["08:44", " with questions. We see this all through Scripture. The Psalms does this a lot. David starts"], ["08:50", " out, \"Why, Lord, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?\""], ["08:56", " Have you ever asked the Lord that question? For who is God beside the Lord and who is"], ["09:02", " a rock acceptor God? Makes you think. And then you answer the question in your mind. Who"], ["09:07", " is? Who may ascend to the mountain of the Lord and who may stand in the holy place?"], ["09:12", " We see this also through the prophets. They did the same thing. Jeremiah, \"Why do the"], ["09:17", " ways of the wicked prosper? Why do the faithless living ease? Doesn't seem fair, God."], ["09:22", " Come back at how long, O Lord, must I cry for help? But you don't listen. Why do you tolerate"], ["09:28", " wrongdoing?\" And we even see God do this. Remember with Job? Job's asking all these questions"], ["09:34", " to God and then Job, chapter 38, God says, \"The Lord says to Job in the world when?\" And"], ["09:40", " he says, \"Who's this that darkness counsel by words without knowledge?\" Now prepare yourself"], ["09:46", " like a man and I will question you and you will answer me. Where were you when I laid"], ["09:51", " the foundations out there? Tell me if you have understanding probing questions. Probing questions"], ["09:59", " are essential for deepening understanding, encouraging critical thinking, and fostering"], ["10:06", " meaningful conversations. They push individuals to think beyond surface level answers and"], ["10:11", " explore deeper insights. They help us uncover details that might otherwise be overlooked,"], ["10:17", " ensuring a more complete understanding. John Harris does this to me all the time. I'll"], ["10:23", " come into an elders meeting and I'll be like, \"Oh, I got this great idea.\" And John will"], ["10:26", " go, \"Hey, well, have you thought of this? Or what about that?\" And I'm like, \"Oh, John,"], ["10:30", " you're beating me up with all these questions.\" And that's good for me. It tightens me up."], ["10:33", " It makes me think clearly about what we need to do. Probing questions strengthen communication."], ["10:40", " The peer listening ministry. They know this one, right? Probing questions promote active"], ["10:45", " listening and engagement making conversations more productive. \"Well, well, how did you feel"], ["10:50", " about that? Or, you know, what's going on?\" So you're drawing people into a deeper conversation"], ["10:56", " and they enhance learning. Often teachers do this, right? They ask questions to the class."], ["11:03", " Sometimes I do this to you. I'll ask a question and leave a gap for you to think about"], ["11:08", " what's coming next, just like that. So whether it's education, business, or personal"], ["11:14", " interaction, probing questions refine ideas, expand knowledge. Naomi, she does this to help"], ["11:20", " people, the people she's trying to communicate with, she does this so they can think about"], ["11:24", " the issues that she's grappling with and then come to her same conclusions. My daughter,"], ["11:30", " shall I not seek security for you? We're just like, yeah? And then her answer. But in the"], ["11:39", " form of a question, Boaz, is he not a relative? So Naomi asked Ruth the question so she"], ["11:47", " can understand Naomi's train of thought so that Ruth will come to the same conclusions"], ["11:52", " that she has and what's the conclusion that Naomi's come to here? Go ask Boaz to marry"], ["12:00", " you. And here's how you're going to do it. Let me show you how. So as he says, this"], ["12:07", " is crazy. First number three. Wash yourself. Well, that's a good first step, ladies."], ["12:14", " Just, girl wash your face. Put on your best garment. Go down to the threshing floor, but"], ["12:24", " do not make yourself known until he's finished eating and drinking. And then it shall"], ["12:28", " be when he lies down that you shall notice the place he lies and go in on covers feet"], ["12:35", " and lie down and he'll tell you what you should do. Now, for your information, this"], ["12:41", " is not a prescription of how to get a marriage proposal. Let's not get confused about what"], ["12:47", " narrative passages, historical books are teaching us. This is not teaching you how to"], ["12:52", " find love. This is a story about how Ruth got a husband, not you, sneaking into somebody's"], ["12:58", " house and covering their feet. It's a good way to get shot or arrested. Not a marriage"], ["13:03", " proposal. But there is some practical takeaway here. And maybe it's this. Naomi is Jewish"], ["13:12", " and she knows the Jewish customs. She's been married before. So seems that she would be"], ["13:17", " a good person to listen to it for advice on how to marry a Jewish guy. Someone who knows"], ["13:22", " the laws knows the customs. So was already accomplished the feet. No pun intended. Well,"], ["13:27", " she wasn't intended. It's a dad joke. Sorry. She's accomplished the feet. Also someone"], ["13:34", " who loves you wants what's best for you. Chances are that's a good person to ask advice"], ["13:38", " of. You know, back when I was dating Eliana, I was working as youth pastor in this church"], ["13:44", " in Canada. And I had befriended some folks who were already married. They were like eight"], ["13:49", " to ten years older than me, the faucets and the tailors. And they were already had some"], ["13:53", " families, little ones. And they were serving in the church. So I watched what they were"], ["13:57", " doing in their life. And I was picking up pornies pointers from them. So when I decided"], ["14:02", " well, I think I want to get married. I didn't call my single friends from college. I didn't"], ["14:06", " call Mark Lee you. Why did he know? He's down in college flop it around. I don't know what"], ["14:11", " he was doing. I didn't call my high school friends. I called my father and I called these"], ["14:16", " older married guys. People who already know how to do what you're aiming at doing. That's"], ["14:21", " probably the person to get the counsel from. Like I said, two weeks ago, we should expand"], ["14:26", " our friend group to include people who can mentor you and guide you. Hey, I want to get"], ["14:32", " married. I think I'd like to start a family. What should I do? Don't go to TikTok for advice"], ["14:36", " on that. You want a successful marriage. Go to people who already been married for a while."], ["14:44", " Wayne Sandy, how long have you been married? 51 years. Wayne wasn't even sure if you look"], ["14:49", " at Sandy. She's right on that. You know, maybe talk to Wayne and Sandy if you want to know"], ["14:53", " how to stay married. Good job. So proud of you all."], ["14:58", " So Ruth is good at taking advice. She said to her mother-in-law, \"All that you say for me"], ["15:05", " to do, I will do.\" Let's read the action here, verse number six. \"When down to the threshing"], ["15:11", " floor, did according to all their mother-in-law, struck at her, and Boaz had eaten a"], ["15:15", " drunk, it was heart was cheerful, he lied down. At the end of a heap of grain, and she"], ["15:20", " came softly, uncovered his feet.\" So what does that mean? The book of Ruth itself does"], ["15:29", " not explain what the act of uncovering Boaz's feet symbolizes. So as a good Bible student,"], ["15:37", " when you can't find the explanation in the book that you're reading, then you broaden"], ["15:41", " and you look at where it's spoken of in other passages. Where is this type of action found"], ["15:47", " in other references? So the phrase \"soles of the feet\" appears in various contexts"], ["15:52", " in the Old Testament, always symbolizing possession, dominion, divine presence. So Deuteronomy"], ["16:00", " chapter 11, verse 24, God promises your lights, \"Every place where the souls of your feet"], ["16:05", " tread will be yours.\" And he said the same thing to Joshua, \"When you enter the land,"], ["16:11", " every place the souls of your feet, all the land that touches, that will be your inheritance.\""], ["16:17", " Also, Ezekiel chapter 43, \"God declares, \"Son of man, this is the place of my throne"], ["16:24", " and the place where the souls of my feet where I will dwell among Israel forever.\""], ["16:30", " So in that passage, the phrase \"soles of the feet\" is symbolizing God's abiding presence"], ["16:35", " in the temple. Now we also see the act of bowing and prostrateing at someone's feet as"], ["16:42", " a sign of what? Humility and reverence, Psalmist 110, verse number 1, \"It's written,"], ["16:50", " the Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand and I will make your enemies a footstool"], ["16:57", " for your feet.'\" So the verse is a messianic prophecy indicating victory over enemies."], ["17:04", " But there's also another level of symbolic meaning. Being barefoot in the Old Testament"], ["17:09", " was also associated with humility, mourning, servitude, or even reverence. You remember"], ["17:15", " when Moses came upon the burning bush and what did God say to him out of the burning bush?"], ["17:21", " Take off your shoes. That's holy ground. And the same thing was said to Joshua when the"], ["17:26", " angel, the Lord showed up. Joshua came up and said, \"Who are you?\" He said, \"Take off"], ["17:29", " your shoes. This is holy ground.\" So it's an act of respect and submission of God. In"], ["17:34", " other books we see that walking barefoot was communicating grief and distress. You know"], ["17:40", " that they had the act of sackcloth and ashes, also going naked or barefoot was showing"], ["17:46", " grief and distress. Like when David had to flee Jerusalem because Absalom was taking over,"], ["17:52", " he left barefoot and walking out weeping. When the prophet Isaiah was instructed to go"], ["17:59", " barefoot and naked for three years as a prophetic sign to the nations and then the prophet"], ["18:04", " Micah said, \"I must go barefoot and naked emphasizing the sorrow for the impending judgment"], ["18:10", " that was coming on the nation.\" So throughout the Old Testament, barefoot was a powerful"], ["18:14", " visual representation of submission and suffering. Barefoot is communicating something's"], ["18:21", " wrong, something's wrong. By uncovering bow as a speed, Ruth is drawing bow as attention"], ["18:27", " to the need. So practically speaking, when bow as wakes up in the middle of the night,"], ["18:33", " nothing feels off. It's feet are cold, right? So typically I don't struggle with cold feet,"], ["18:40", " but often, Ilionis cold feet wake me up. So, or keep me awake and I lay down and then"], ["18:46", " she puts her feet right up on me and she drains the heat out of my body into her two little"], ["18:53", " ice boxes that are on the end of her legs. Bow as is awakened and he's startled to find"], ["19:01", " someone at his feet. Now, I don't think we should really try to get hung up on the imagery"], ["19:05", " being confused. What exactly does all that action communicate because the story has dialogue?"], ["19:12", " Bow as gets the message because Ruth lays it out very plainly and women, this is good"], ["19:18", " to know this because guys can't read your mind just giving us straight facts, really helps."], ["19:23", " So verse 8, it happened at midnight. The man was startled and he said, \"So a woman"], ["19:27", " laying in his feet, who are you?\" She said, \"I'm Ruth, you're maidservant. Take your"], ["19:31", " maidservant under your wing for you are close relative. You are the kinsman redeemer.\""], ["19:40", " So there's now ambiguity here. Ruth's very straightforward. Why she tripped up in the middle"], ["19:44", " of the night? Why she uncovered his feet? I need covering. I need to go all. We studied."], ["19:50", " We discovered last week what the kinsman redeemer is. If you want to know the depth of"], ["19:54", " that, go back. I'll just summarize it now. The kinsman redeemer is a family member who"], ["20:00", " can legally pay the family's debt, reclaim the property, the lost land, marry the widow"], ["20:06", " Ruth and raise up a child to carry on a limalex heritage. Now, this is interesting hebrew"], ["20:14", " idiom here. Take me under your wing. The Hebrew word is kanaf, can be translated wing,"], ["20:21", " or can also be translated corner of the skirt. Who has wing? Whose interpretation"], ["20:27", " is wings? Which, who has corner of the skirt? Some of you have corner of the skirt, okay."], ["20:31", " So the imagery of being taken under God's wing, that appears several times in Scripture"], ["20:36", " does it. Symbolizes protection and care like a mother hen and gathering the chicks."], ["20:43", " This is what the imagery is communicating and the psalm says. He will cover you under his"], ["20:47", " feathers, under his wings, that you may have refuge. His faithfulness is a shield and"], ["20:53", " a bulwark. And then again, how precious is your loving kindness, oh Lord, and the children"], ["20:58", " of men take refuge in the shadow of your wings. And Boaz even, remember, look at chapter"], ["21:04", " 12, chapter 2, verse 12. Boaz even gave that blessing to Ruth. He said, \"May the Lord"], ["21:09", " the God of Israel, under whose wings you've come to take refuge, reward you.\" So this"], ["21:15", " is already this imagery he's blessed her with. And now she's turning that back around."], ["21:19", " Now some English translations say, \"spread your cloak over me.\" And this action likewise"], ["21:25", " appears in the Old Testament as a symbolic gesture or protection, commitment, and even marriage."], ["21:30", " Ezekiel chapter 16, where God speaks metaphorically about the covenant that he has with Israel,"], ["21:36", " he said, \"I spread my cloak over you, covering your nakedness. I pledge myself to you"], ["21:42", " entering into a covenant with you and you became mine.\" So this illustrates God's care and"], ["21:47", " commitment to his children Israel. Either way you translate that word, canath, wing, or cloak,"], ["21:53", " it still communicates the same action, covering. So by uncovering Boaz's feats, communicate"], ["22:01", " something's wrong, there's this shameful situation, Ruth being at a position, at his feet,"], ["22:07", " communicates a position of submission. So someone in the family has need, it's Ruth and Naomi."], ["22:14", " They're in a position of need, a poverty. They're in a position of affliction. Boaz's feet are"], ["22:19", " exposed because he's now being asked to act as the kinsman redeemer and meet the need."], ["22:25", " Shelter, cover them. Before we see Boaz's response, let me ask you this question."], ["22:36", " Is anyone here in need? Does anyone feel like Ruth and Naomi afflicted, struggling to survive?"], ["22:45", " Not at rest. If you are, I've got good news for you. The promises of God, my God shall supply"], ["22:51", " all your needs. According to his riches in glory found in Christ Jesus, Jesus knew what we needed."], ["23:01", " God already showed in his law what was needed, the redemption of our sins, a sacrifice for sin,"], ["23:09", " the spotless lamb was needed. And John the Baptist when Jesus came and started his ministry,"], ["23:14", " said, behold the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. And Jesus gave his life"], ["23:21", " and his death covered our debt, his payment of his blood covered our debt. This means that Jesus"], ["23:29", " has got us covered. First John chapter two, my little children, I write these things for you"], ["23:35", " that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, you got an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the"], ["23:41", " righteous. And if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to"], ["23:47", " cleanse us from all unrighteousness. So by going to the feet of Jesus and asking for help,"], ["23:53", " we're acting just like Ruth. Now some people here don't think they're all that needy."], ["23:59", " And if Naomi said, you know, go lay on Bo S feet and ask for help, you'd say, heck no,"], ["24:05", " I ain't laying at no man's feet. He better come kiss my feet. I ain't that desperate."], ["24:12", " Remember, remember Mary when she washed the feet of Jesus with her hair and she kissed his feet,"], ["24:25", " why did she do that? Because she knew who he was, the Messiah, the Son of God, royalty,"], ["24:34", " divinity, right there for her to touch and she worshiped and she sacrificed and she poured out"], ["24:42", " that perfume worth a whole year's salary, this unique opportunity she had right before it had"], ["24:47", " such God and so she embraced his feet. The kinsman redeemer for Ruth is Bo S, the kinsman redeemer for"], ["24:57", " us is Jesus. Do you understand who he is, what he's done, what he is currently doing? Remember"], ["25:05", " what Jesus said to the church, a layon to see in the book of Revelation. I don't know how that"], ["25:09", " was a year ago, but you remember that, don't you? He said to that church, because you say, I'm rich"], ["25:14", " and I've become wealthy. I don't need anything. I don't need no man. I guess nobody's feet."], ["25:19", " Do you not know that you're wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked? I counsel you to"], ["25:25", " buy from me gold, refined in the fire that you might be rich with white garments that you might be"], ["25:29", " clothed.

Now, behold, Boes"], ["02:34", " came from the Bethlehem and said to the Reapers, \"The Lord be with you,\" and they"], ["02:38", " said, \"The Lord bless you.\" And Boes said to his servants who was in charge of"], ["02:43", " the Reapers, \"Who's young woman's this?\" So, the Reaper who was in charge of the"], ["02:47", " Reapers answered, \"Well, it is the young Moabite woman who came back, but Naomi"], ["02:50", " from the country of Moab.\" And she said, \"Please, let me glean and gather after the"], ["02:56", " Reapers amongst the sheaves.\" So, she came and has continued from morning until"], ["03:02", " now, though she rested a little while in the house. Then Boes said to Ruth, \"You"], ["03:07", " will listen, my daughter, will you not? Do not go to glean in another field, nor go"], ["03:13", " from here, but stay close to my young women, let your eyes be on the field which"], ["03:19", " they reap and go after them.\" Have I not commanded the young men not to touch"], ["03:23", " you? And when you are thirsty, go to the Fessels and drink from what the young"], ["03:28", " men have drawn. So, she went, she fell on her face and bowed to the ground and"], ["03:33", " said to him, \"Why have I found favor in your eyes that I should that you should"], ["03:38", " take notice of me since I am a foreigner?\" And Boes answered and said to her, \"It has"], ["03:46", " been fully reported to me all that you've done for your mother-in-law since the"], ["03:51", " death of your husband and how you left your father and your mother and the land of"], ["03:55", " your birth and have come to a people whom you did not know before. The Lord"], ["03:59", " repay your work in a full reward be given, but given you by the Lord God of"], ["04:07", " Israel under whose wings you've come for refuge.\" And she said, \"Let me find favor"], ["04:13", " in your sight, my Lord, for you have comforted me. You spoke in kindly to your"], ["04:18", " maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants.\" So, we see here in"], ["04:26", " verse 2 that Ruth clearly states what she is setting out to do. What is it? She"], ["04:33", " says, \"I want to go find favor.\" So, \"find\" is the verb. It's the action. The"], ["04:44", " Hebrew is matzal. It means to secure, to acquire, to get something which one"], ["04:50", " was seeking. This word is communicating some intentionality. And item is lost or"], ["04:55", " missing in the person's life and they feel a need. When I wake up in the"], ["05:00", " morning, I will pick up my phone off the nightstand. I don't say, \"Hey, I found"], ["05:06", " my phone. I knew exactly where it was. I checked my phone.\" See what the"], ["05:11", " temperature is, what time it is, all that. But say the night before it had fallen"], ["05:17", " down in between the car seats of the car. And I had realized that. And maybe"], ["05:22", " after supper, I noticed, \"Hey, let me check my phone.\" \"Oh, wait, where did I put"], ["05:26", " it? Did I leave it at work? Did I leave it on the counter when I came in? Where"], ["05:34", " did I last have it?\" Now, I want to find it because I'm feeling the need to use"], ["05:40", " it. I'm feeling inconvenience for not having it. \"Well, Anna, would you call my"], ["05:45", " phone?\" And then after spending 20 minutes of looking, I announced with relief,"], ["05:50", " \"Hey, good news. I found it.\" Now, I want to find it because I'm feeling the need"], ["05:59", " to use it. Depending on how bad the need determines how intentional someone is"], ["06:08", " about finding what they are missing. How much you feel the need, the missing of the"], ["06:13", " missing item will dictate how much effort you put in to go find it. So this is"], ["06:18", " something to think about parents who's graduating. If you are wanting your"], ["06:25", " children to be independent, motivated, competent individuals, at some point,"], ["06:30", " you're going to have to let them experience some needs. Because if you give them"], ["06:36", " everything, they will feel no need to go find anything for themselves. You can"], ["06:41", " say, \"Hey, you need to find a job.\" But if you continue on meeting their needs,"], ["06:44", " then your words are not true. They don't need to. There's no need. You want them"], ["06:52", " to. You feel the need. But they're not going to go get the job until they"], ["06:57", " feel the need. So your job is to let them feel it. Let the feel it. That means"], ["07:04", " stop paying for their stuff. Kick them off to your phone plan. Don't pay for"], ["07:09", " them eating out. Top buying them clothes. Whatever. Charge them some rent. Take"], ["07:14", " them off your insurance. I'm not talking about doing your high kids, okay? Don't"], ["07:17", " worry. Don't worry, Kaylin, you're not going to get booted out yet. Two years"], ["07:21", " you will be, but not yet. But you know, 18 plus, you know, some guys are 48 still"], ["07:28", " living at home in the basement. You say, \"You need to get your license.\" Well,"], ["07:32", " not if you're driving them anywhere. If you're driving them everywhere, they don't"], ["07:36", " have any need to get that. So stop taking them places. I decided I wanted a job"], ["07:41", " when I was a kid. Why? Because I loved working and I was just so"], ["07:45", " industrious. No. Because I wanted stuff and my parents didn't give me any money"], ["07:50", " to buy things I wanted. Mom, can I have a treat? No, you don't need a treat."], ["07:55", " Kind of judging, Mom. Well, I want a treat. Oh, you want a treat. You got any money?"], ["08:01", " No. Well, there you go. You can't get one. Because my parents didn't give me"], ["08:06", " what I wanted, I figured out how to work so I could get it for myself. And this"], ["08:11", " also has spiritual ramifications. Some people find the Lord and some people do"], ["08:17", " not. You know, who doesn't find the Lord and why they don't find the Lord? The"], ["08:23", " people who aren't looking for Him don't find Him. People will say, \"Oh, I've"], ["08:28", " never seen God. I've never heard God speak to me. It's because they're not"], ["08:32", " looking and they're not listening.\" Matter of fact, maybe you're trying hard to"], ["08:36", " not hear from Him. Do you remember those two Chinese exchange students that"], ["08:41", " lived with us last year? They went to Reichen. Remember them? They had to come to"], ["08:46", " church with us every Sunday, but they didn't want to. They didn't want to hear"], ["08:51", " anything about God and they'd sit there slouched and on their phones and trying"], ["08:57", " to sleep during the service. They just didn't want to hear it. Then one day Alice"], ["09:04", " had this Bible assignment where she had to write a whole essay about an"], ["09:07", " apostle in all of a sudden she had a need and she wanted to talk to us about"], ["09:13", " the Bible. Grades were a big deal for those kids and they needed the grade so"], ["09:18", " now they wanted the help. You know and I know that our kids need God. We know"], ["09:25", " everyone needs God but they won't look for Him until they feel the need. So we"], ["09:32", " have to be patient and wait for people to feel it and then they'll want to"], ["09:37", " find God. Will that work? Will they actually have that kind of need that drives"], ["09:42", " them there? Well, here's what I know. One day you wake up and life is just punched"], ["09:47", " you right in the throat. You can't breathe. The chaos is smashing you and that's"], ["09:52", " when you will start really looking for the help. When you feel the consequences"], ["09:57", " of sin and the brokenness, when you feel the loss, you will want to find the Lord."], ["10:03", " Sains, that's why we got to keep praying and we got to be faithful and patient to"], ["10:08", " wait. Your loved ones will find their way back once they feel the need. Ruth"], ["10:16", " feels the need so she goes to the field. What's she looking for? Now I only"], ["10:21", " please can I go to find? What is it? Favor. The Hebrew word is \"cachane\". It means"], ["10:30", " favor. It means grace. This is Ruth's purpose statement. What is on her vision"], ["10:40", " board or what the kids might say understanding the assignments. The assignment is"], ["10:46", " not money. The assignment is not food. What's Ruth's purpose statement? Find"], ["10:54", " favor. Two questions you ought to ask and answer. What's our business and"], ["11:01", " how's business? So many people in life are looking for something. They don't"], ["11:07", " even know what they're looking for. What's our business? Ruth's very clear."], ["11:11", " She's very intentional on what she's looking for. It's favor. That's her"], ["11:15", " business. Why? What's so important about favor? When something's your"], ["11:20", " favorite, it's what you immediately look for. It's what you always choose. My"], ["11:26", " favorite Mexican restaurant is Celsius, right? And I go to Celsius. I get the"], ["11:33", " same thing every time. Casey Dia, Texana for the last 18 years. I'll even read"], ["11:40", " the menu. Don't even look at it. I don't care.

You want to go to Plaza Tolteca? No."], ["11:53", " Either Plaza, don't want. I always choose salsa. That's favor. If you look at the"], ["12:03", " people with fame and fortune, you might think, oh, well, you know, they earned it"], ["12:06", " because they're just so talented. There's millions of talented people. There's"], ["12:15", " millions of hardworking people. Ever ever watched those edition shows, you know,"], ["12:19", " America's got talent or the voice or, you know, American Idol? Any of those shows?"], ["12:25", " Here's a fun fact about Pastor Mark. Guess what? He auditioned for American"], ["12:34", " Idol. No way. Did he win? Yes. He's working a big Bible church. I mean, that's"], ["12:41", " the grand prize right there. Get the big time here, eh? I've heard people on the"], ["12:50", " radio and I thought, eh, Ricky's better. The ones you think are talented."], ["12:57", " There's always someone comparable. There's always someone working just as hard."], ["13:00", " The difference often is this person had an opportunity was given the shot"], ["13:06", " because someone said, ooh, that's my favorite. Of all the people in American"], ["13:11", " Idol, they said, Mark's my favorite. Let's choose him. He's my favorite. And that's"], ["13:20", " what the game of life is all about. Finding favor. When I applied here to Faith"], ["13:24", " Bible Church, the committee had 40 resumes, a stack and they said, well,"], ["13:30", " Canadians are clearly better people. So, you know, let's just get rid of all these"], ["13:36", " 39 Americans. Just get them out of here. I think that's what happened. Did you"], ["13:42", " know that Faith Bible Church had to pay thousands of dollars extra to get my"], ["13:48", " wife and family here through the immigration process? I wasn't better. I was a"], ["13:53", " hassle. Why did they decide to do that? Because Dick Novellow likes to spend"], ["13:58", " money? Ha, you know, that's not true. Somehow, some way I had favor over those"], ["14:06", " other candidates. How do you get favor? That's the assignment. That's our"], ["14:14", " business. Finding favor. Let's see if we can discover how Ruth finds favor."], ["14:19", " Okay. So, versus one through three, we see here Boess, who's of the family of"], ["14:27", " the lima, like he's very wealthy. Ruth the Moabites says to Naomi, let me go to"], ["14:31", " the fields, glean the heads of grain after him in whose site I might find favor."], ["14:35", " And so Naomi said, go my daughter and she left and went and gleaned in the fields"], ["14:39", " after the reapers and it happened to come to the part of the field belonging to"], ["14:43", " Boess, which was of the family of the lima. Okay. So, first thing in order to find"], ["14:48", " favor is you got to get up and go look for it. You got to get to work. Ruth starts"], ["14:55", " with something she can do, something she knows how to do. Just pick some stuff up, right?"], ["15:04", " So here's a fun fact. You know, you teach your little kids how to pick up their toys and"], ["15:09", " pick up their room. You're actually giving them a life skill. You can make money just knowing"], ["15:13", " how to pick stuff up. It's brilliant, right? Clean your room kid and you can make a living."], ["15:20", " Cleaning other people's rooms, right? Cleaning up after people. It's good money in that."], ["15:24", " So, gleaming, she's going to glean. Gleaming is simply going to a field that has been"], ["15:29", " harvested and picking up all the leftovers, picking up what the harvesters miss. Anyone"], ["15:35", " ever gleaned? You ever did some gleaming? Okay. When, uh, we would go to the potato fields"], ["15:42", " in New Brunswick and Eliana, we gleaned. We learned to glean in the four years that we lived"], ["15:47", " in New Brunswick, uh, there were some things that Eliana really did enjoy and one of them"], ["15:52", " was the abundance of fresh free produce. We had a big backyard and we had a space for"], ["15:59", " a garden in our neighbor raised beef cattle. And in the spring, he'd be out on his land"], ["16:04", " with the manure spreader, flinging a whole winter's worth of manure all over the fields."], ["16:09", " And I told him, oh, Eliana would like a garden. He said, ha ha. And he came over this manure"], ["16:13", " spreader and just put it all over the field in the backyard. And, uh, you know, fertilized"], ["16:21", " it up right some good, eh? So we planted a garden and, uh, had to weed it. But sure enough,"], ["16:28", " we had a bumper crop in the fall. And it didn't cost us anything other than the simple"], ["16:33", " pack of seeds. And we got all this produce. And the other thing, Eliana, appreciated was that"], ["16:38", " the potato farmers were more than willing to let people in the community go into their"], ["16:42", " fields and glean the fields gathering up the potatoes that the harvester had missed."], ["16:46", " You could pick buckets and buckets of potatoes. If you wanted to go glean all summer and"], ["16:53", " fall, there was always something to pick up. There was wild blueberries, there was wild"], ["16:57", " raspberries, uh, early in the summer. You could go down and pick fiddleheads. You may know"], ["17:02", " what a fiddlehead is right from the north. Okay. Mark knows what a fiddlehead is. It's, uh,"], ["17:07", " it's a green that grows, uh, right on the St. John River Valley just along the river. It's"], ["17:12", " like a fern. And then when it first pops up, it's all curled up like a fiddlehead. That's"], ["17:18", " what it looks like. And you can pick them and just all just free. Go down there and pick"], ["17:22", " them all up. And they're like, they're really good. Um, in true English style, my mother,"], ["17:29", " we would boil them and then add vinegar to them. Uh, I think, uh, probably Philiana"], ["17:34", " was cooking them. She would, um, she'd pay him for item with some garlic and they'd be much"], ["17:38", " better. I guarantee I would like them much better. But they were a little crispier like that."], ["17:42", " So I don't worry. I'm any more. I'm now talking about food. And, uh, yeah. So, uh, there"], ["17:53", " was, there was, there was the fiddleheads you could pick. And then there was, uh, the garden"], ["17:57", " would give us the fresh veggies all summer long and the fall, there was the potatoes and"], ["18:00", " then we would go to the apple orchard. So you pick apple orchard and get all these apples"], ["18:04", " and the spondence of food, even for free, if you were prepared to put a little bit of"], ["18:08", " effort in and go gather it up. And there was all this opportunity for blessings that"], ["18:14", " the lamb would produce. However, to get a really good harvest, you have to deal with some"], ["18:20", " BS, some manure. And you got to be prepared to get your hands dirty. And everyone knows"], ["18:26", " who comes to the DMV, the same thing's true down here. Whatever line of work you're in,"], ["18:30", " whatever field you're in, you know, that's true. And evidently you're going to have to deal"], ["18:34", " with some BS, some manure. But if you're willing to put the work in, there's a great"], ["18:40", " amount of opportunities for blessings. In case you didn't notice, I went from literal"], ["18:45", " to metaphorical, right, gleaming in Ruth is literal, but it also symbolizes work, industrious"], ["18:53", "ness, skills that you use to take to the marketplace of life. But let's just make sure that"], ["18:59", " we climb the ladder of abstraction accurately. And we don't affiliate, gleaming with some"], ["19:05", " action or activity that would not bring you favor. So all kinds of ways to make money,"], ["19:10", " but they ain't all good. Remember the assignment is not money. It's favor. So something"], ["19:17", " illegal, something immoral, something that brings shame. That's not what we want. We want"], ["19:23", " respectable and lawful is what we're looking for. So at first glance, gleaming would"], ["19:28", " appear to be not very respectable, right? It's like poor people do it. Is it free-loading?"], ["19:34", " Is it just begging? No, gleaming was something commanded under the law. We see it in Leviticus"], ["19:41", " when you, this is what Moses wrote to all the people when they get the land. When you"], ["19:46", " reap your harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your fields, nor"], ["19:51", " shall you gather the gleanings. You will not glean your vineyards. You shall not gather every"], ["19:57", " grape. You'll leave them for the poor and the stranger. I'm the Lord your God. And then again,"], ["20:03", " in 23, same thing. When you harvest your land, you don't wholly reap the corners. You don't"], ["20:09", " gather the gleaming from your harvest. You leave it for the poor and the stranger. I am the"], ["20:15", " Lord your God. Isn't that interesting? I am the Lord your God. So you're not trusting in the"], ["20:22", " harvest. You're trusting in the Lord's your God. Something to remember, gleaming is a gift"], ["20:29", " from God. Rich or poor, the lands provides for all, Boaz is rich because of the produce of the"], ["20:34", " land. Ruth is poor, but the same produce of the land can meet her need as well. And this"], ["20:40", " is what God intended. Something we all respect is someone who earns an honest day's pay from"], ["20:47", " a honest day's work. No matter what they're doing, whatever work it is, we respect that. And that's"], ["20:55", " the first step to finding favor is our work. Case in point. Skip ahead. Ruth finds favor in Boaz's"], ["21:02", " eyes and we'll unpack all the details, but just skip down to verse number 10 because she asked,"], ["21:06", " why did I find favor in your eyes? And his answer was, has been fully reported to me all that"], ["21:13", " you've done, verse 11 for your mother-in-law, says the death of your husband and how you left your"], ["21:17", " father and your mother in land of your birth and come to a people whom you did not know before,"], ["21:22", " verse 12, the Lord repay your what? Your work. In order to find favor, you have to get up and go look"], ["21:31", " and put in the work. I wonder what kind of crop, Ruth's gleaming. Is this potato? What is this?"], ["21:37", " Do you remember from chapter one, verse 22? What did it say? It was the beginning of the"], ["21:43", " barley harvest. This time of year, barley harvest is April May, one of the first crops of the year"], ["21:54", " for the Israelites. And that's important. And here's why. If you've ever been around any farming,"], ["21:58", " you understand that you make your money after you've harvested your crops and then you sold them,"], ["22:03", " not all of them. Some of them you keep for seed for the next year. Some of them you keep for your"], ["22:08", " own personal use, but the rest you sold and that pile of money would have to take you through to"], ["22:13", " your next cash crop to your next crop is ready. Barley harvest is in the spring, which means what?"], ["22:21", " They just came through the winter and there's nothing being harvested. There's no cash crop. So"], ["22:28", " probably your food supplies are running out, your savings are running out. Barley harvest is the"], ["22:34", " first crop of the year. It is giving the economy a much needed boost. It's restocking the bank"], ["22:40", " account. It's restocking the pantry and a good harvest. People would now be willing to spend some"], ["22:46", " money because now hey, we got something to get out there and boost the economy. So the barley and"], ["22:51", " the weed harvest was even part of the religious life of the people. The spring feast of Israel,"], ["22:57", " people would bring the first fruits of their harvest to the temple and give it to the Lord"], ["23:03", " as an offering, acting in obedience and giving their tithe thus fulfilling the laws of God,"], ["23:09", " assuring that God would continue to bless them and prosper them through the rest of the year."], ["23:14", " Barley was used for bread. He's also used for feeding their livestock. So they're getting fed."], ["23:21", " Their livestock are getting fed and that is also part of the wealth of the people who's their livestock"], ["23:27", " and also used barley for beer, right? So a good harvest was a reason to celebrate and also"], ["23:35", " it provided to you a means to celebrate and Ruth is going to glean during a fruitful harvest."], ["23:41", " The point is is that God is provided the laws that gave Ruth the permission and the protection"], ["23:46", " to glean and God is provided a bountiful harvest for Ruth to participate in. Ruth's just got to"], ["23:52", " go join in and do the things that God blesses. Have you heard that before?"], ["23:58", " She finds herself gleaming in Boaz's field. Now, we hear in verse one that Boaz is a man of"], ["24:08", " great wealth. Let's pivot over to Boaz for a minute. Right away, the author communicates"], ["24:14", " that Goaz has found favor because he has what? Great wealth."], ["24:21", " As we learned last week, God promised to bless those that keep his commandments,"], ["24:28", " but he will also afflict those who disobey and eliminate and Naomi were on the receiving end"], ["24:35", " of affliction. Meanwhile, Boaz and the same lifespan has been on the receiving end of promised"], ["24:42", " blessings. Verse number three, it says at the end there that the field belonged to Boaz,"], ["24:50", " who is of the family of a limalek and that's Naomi's deceased husband and that'll be important"], ["24:57", " later on. So Ruth finds herself in Boaz's field. Boaz comes out to inspect the work. Verse number four,"], ["25:03", " now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, the Lord be with you and the Lord"], ["25:07", " and they said, the Lord bless you. And he's looking and inspecting the servants and then he sees"], ["25:14", " this young gal. So any time a farmer hired me to work a harvest, the owner, who is the farmer,"], ["25:20", " would always be out there working right along side with us. One of my favorite harvest experiences"], ["25:26", " was I worked for a Dutch family in Nova Scotia, Guinadad and Mini Wooster. Guinad had two sons,"], ["25:35", " they were part owners in the farm with their folks and worked along with him. And I was the age"], ["25:39", " of Conrad's youngest son, Derek and Conrad worked this hard during hay season 12, 14 hour days,"], ["25:48", " from the time the doo burned off. Well, after son went down and we were still unloading"], ["25:53", " trailers into the barns, we worked hard, but he didn't sit in the house all while we young fellers"], ["25:59", " wrote there doing the work. He was probably in his 60s, but he was right out in the field working with"], ["26:05", " us the entire time. And at the end of the day, Conrad would always say, \"Oh, boys, y'all worked really hard."], ["26:11", " Thank you, boys. Thank you.\" But the really special part of the day was Conrad's wife,"], ["26:18", " Mini and her daughter-in-law's, would make supper for the whole crew. And at 530, we would"], ["26:24", " break for supper. Mini said, \"It's supper time. Coon, bring the boys in.\" So then we'd all come in"], ["26:30", " and we'd sit on the picking tables outside because we stunk and she didn't want us in the house."], ["26:34", " But we'd sit out there on the picking tables and Conrad would lead us in blessing the food,"], ["26:39", " and then we would have a big farm, fresh, homemade dinner, roast beef, potatoes, corn on the"], ["26:47", " cob, homemade rules, preserves because northern people preserve everything and all these"], ["26:53", " preservatives, and then of course, dessert because they bake lots of great food."], ["27:00", " And everything Conrad did, he said an example for us. The hard work, the being gracious and"], ["27:09", " generous, he didn't have to have his wife and his daughter-in-law's make a supper. They just did"], ["27:14", " that to be generous with us.

I can only speculate as to why, but it has something"], ["37:00", " to do with what she believed about the Lord. Did you catch that in verse 17? In her"], ["37:10", " pledge, she says, \"Your people, my people, your God, my God, where you die, I will die,"], ["37:15", " I will be buried.\" Then she says, \"The Lord.\" What do you observe about that?

What does that tell you? That is the"], ["37:40", " formal name. What? Yahweh. That is the name of the God of Israel. Naomi said, \"Go back"], ["37:49", " to your gods. Go back to your gods and Moab.\" She says, Yahweh, the Lord. She wasn't"], ["37:57", " going back to the gods of Egypt. She wasn't trusting in the gods of Canaanite. She was"], ["38:02", " turning to Yahweh in that ought not be overlooked because this story is not about learning"], ["38:08", " how to have love and loyalty like Ruth. It's not about being good and good things will"], ["38:15", " come to you, karma and the universe will repay you. Oh, vibes. Good vibes. This is specifically"], ["38:24", " about our relationship with Yahweh, the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the great"], ["38:32", " I am who was and is and is to come. And the reason why we studied this book because it is"], ["38:42", " the special revelation of the one true God, the things that he is done and doing and wants"], ["38:49", " us to know and ignoring him and rejecting him has brought Israel affliction, but trusting"], ["38:56", " him and seeking him likewise has ramifications. So let's be clear on the theological message"], ["39:03", " of the story. It's not be good to your mother-in-law, even though that would be nice."], ["39:09", " And she would think that was lovely. Pass to Rob. This was such an easy softball that"], ["39:16", " was lobbed up to you. Why didn't you just do a nice Mother's Day message that we could"], ["39:21", " just say love your mother's and your mother-in-law's because that's not what Ruth is about."], ["39:27", " It's about a step of faith honoring the Lord, not moms. Naomi was being afflicted by God"], ["39:34", " and she returned to him and Ruth takes a step of faith to follow and trust in Yahweh."], ["39:40", " And then Naomi does a very wise thing. She realizes that this was not about what she thought"], ["39:48", " was best for Ruth. She had already given her wisdom and shared her opinion. You know,"], ["39:53", " go with your sister, go back to your family and your gods, but after she hears Ruth's"], ["39:59", " declaration, Naomi is wise enough to shut her mouth and let Ruth come with her to the land"], ["40:07", " of Yahweh, verse 18. And when she saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped"], ["40:15", " speaking to her. There is a time to stop speaking and let people follow the Lord as the"], ["40:24", " Holy Spirit is leading them. Us older people speak into the parents, the grandparents,"], ["40:33", " all the people that got all these opinions about what the young people are doing and how"], ["40:41", " they're parenting their children and how they're organizing their lives. We have all these"], ["40:47", " opinions about what they should be doing. You know, it'd be better if you would. I think"], ["40:52", " you ought to. What we need to do is when our children are trusting in the Lord, we need"], ["41:01", " to let God lead them and not us try to be the Holy Spirit. We need to know when to stop"], ["41:09", " micro-managing and treating them like children, let them grow and develop in their faith,"], ["41:16", " let them even have some affliction so that their faith can be made gold and the Holy"], ["41:22", " Spirit can lead them.

It's going to be hard, but God is going to lead her"], ["41:32", " through the affliction to a great blessing. Verse number 19. Now the two of them went along"], ["41:40", " they came to Bethlehem and it happened when they came to Bethlehem. All the city was"], ["41:43", " excited because of them and the woman said, \"Is this not Naomi?\" But she said, \"Don't call"], ["41:48", " me Naomi.

And as she returns, she brings Ruth with her."], ["42:18", " And Ruth's got a plan for Ruth. So you know what's amazing. We see this time and time"], ["42:24", " again. When people go through trials and afflictions and return to God, they often influence"], ["42:30", " other people to come with them. People go out there and they live their lives and disobedience"], ["42:36", " and sin and they hurt themselves and finally they repent and they return. And when they do"], ["42:40", " that, they end up influencing somebody to come out of that mess. Somebody who is in that"], ["42:44", " mess with them is like, \"Oh, well, you're going to go that way. Well, I'm also giving"], ["42:48", " it a try too.\" And God always has this way of using our pain and brokenness to help someone"], ["42:54", " else.

So many jail ministries"], ["43:17", " happy because some disobedient child of God ends up in jail, repents to their sin and then"], ["43:22", " they help people in jail find Jesus. Isn't that amazing? This is how God will use something"], ["43:28", " that seems like it's going to destroy us and turn it for good. And He loves to do that"], ["43:34", " through our brokenness and weakness and failure. He brings glory to His name. And God loves"], ["43:39", " to use broken people because in our weakness, His strengths are showcased. And we see this"], ["43:45", " over and over God using the least of these.

what don't they like about Jack Hibbs and his prayer?"], ["03:00", " Well, in a nutshell, Pastor Jack Hibbs preaches the Word of God."], ["03:06", " He declares that people need to be saved from their sins and Jesus, the Son of God, is"], ["03:11", " the Savior."], ["03:12", " Well, you're not supposed to pray to people to be saved from sins."], ["03:17", " You're not supposed to pray in Jesus

can and can do."], ["03:31", " Basically, you're not to pray to any real God, you're not supposed to make any statements"], ["03:35", " like that."], ["03:36", " You're just supposed to have vague statements to know God in particular."], ["03:40", " And Jack Hibbs broke the rules."], ["03:43", " Well, the fact that the U.S. government rules for guest chaplains who pray in Congress are,"], ["03:53", " you're not supposed to mention the name of Jesus in a prayer proves our government is anathema."], ["04:00", " They have damned themselves."], ["04:03", " And while I do respect Pastor Hibbs wanting to proclaim truth through that prayer, the"], ["04:09", " prayer did not bring God's blessing upon Congress."], ["04:13", " The fact is, until the nation's leaders humbled themselves and

destruction."], ["04:31", " How do I know?"], ["04:32", " Well, because Jesus said in Matthew chapter 7, \"Enter through the narrow gate, for the"], ["04:37", " gate is wide, and the way is broad, that leads to destruction.\""], ["04:41", " And there's many who go through that."], ["04:43", " The gates is narrow, and the way is constricted, that leads to life, and there's few that"], ["04:50",

the way, the, and the life, no one comes to the Father, but by me.\""], ["05:21", " Since December of 2019, Faith Bible Church has been studying about Jesus, well, probably"], ["05:27", " before that too, we were studying about Jesus, but we started the book of Luke in 2019,"], ["05:32", " and Luke's aim with his gospel was to give us the exact truth of who Jesus is."], ["05:38", " And we learned the exact truth of Jesus, the Son of Man, his earthly ministry, all that"], ["05:43", " he did."], ["05:44", " Then, in May of 2022, we began learning how much greater, how much better Jesus the Messiah"], ["05:52", " is, and his plans that he have for us."], ["05:55", " His plans are better than anything else in life."], ["05:58", " And for the last 20 months, we have been affirming and strengthening our faith in Jesus"], ["06:03", " and praise God through the last 20 months, we've seen people come to believe in Jesus."], ["06:09", " And that is what we said, if you want to go back and listen, on May 22, 2022, when we"], ["06:16", " started Hebrews, I declare to you, this book will affirm our faith and strengthen our"], ["06:22", " faith, and this book will convince people to believe in Jesus in trusting Him as Lord"], ["06:26", " and Savior."], ["06:27", " And how many baptisms have we had since 2022, 54."], ["06:34", " Since we started our study on Hebrews, 54 people publicly declared their faith in Jesus."], ["06:40", " And we have another one today."], ["06:43", " The book of Hebrews also warned us to not fall away, to not reject Jesus."], ["06:49", " And we gave those warnings and sad to say, \"Some did not heed it, and some have fall"], ["06:54", " away.\""], ["06:55", " This is a prophecy, it's a fulfillment of prophecy, because Jesus said, and we'll look"], ["06:59", " at today in the last days, many will fall away."], ["07:04", " So now that we've finished Hebrews, what do we study next?"], ["07:08", " Luke was the exact truths of Jesus, the Son

what is next, because Jesus has revealed to us what is coming next."], ["07:23", " So we've now turned our attention to the book that Jesus himself revealed, the message"], ["07:29", " Jesus gave to the churches, we're going to study the book of Revelation."], ["07:37", " We learned who Jesus was when he first came, he's now seated at the right hand of"], ["07:42", " the throne of God."],

to interpret it, we use our historical, grammatical, literal interpretation"], ["08:36", " methods, and we want to know the history and the context."], ["08:39", " So this book was written in around '96 AD, what was going on in the life setting of the"], ["08:45", " author, and the church in '96 AD, who's the author, it's John, the beloved, the youngest"], ["08:52", " disciple of Jesus, John who wrote the book of, yeah, gospel of John."], ["08:58", " And then, for a second and third, he's really repetitious, can we get a new name here."], ["09:04", " Now the oldest and last disciple writes the last book of the Bible."], ["09:08", " Jesus has died, rose again, has set it into heaven roughly 70 years prior to this."], ["09:14", " In Scripture, a generation is 40 years, John in Revelation is speaking to the second generation"], ["09:20", " of believers since Jesus' ascension."], ["09:22", " Well, what has happened since then?"], ["09:24", " Well, you remember, of course you remember, the book of Hebrews was written around,"], ["09:29", " '65 AD."], ["09:30", " See, you knew that."], ["09:31", " And by the time the gospel had been preached all over the Roman Empire in '65 AD, the"], ["09:37", " disciples were effective at the Great Commission, churches were planted, but as we learned"], ["09:42", " in Hebrews, there was lots of persecution, especially to the Jewish believers in Jerusalem."], ["09:47", " Paul had been in prison, and he was in Rome in the time of the writing of Hebrews."], ["09:51", " And since '65 AD, where we left off, it's now '96 AD, do you think, in that amount"], ["09:57", " of time, things have gotten better or worse for the church?"], ["10:01", " Both, actually, because of the intense persecution in Jerusalem by the Sanhedrin, the Hebrew"], ["10:07", " believers sold all their properties, sold all their businesses and homes, and moved out of"], ["10:12", " Jerusalem."], ["10:13", " Oh, that sounds bad, but that was God's protection, because in '70 AD, Rome sacked the"], ["10:20", " city of Jerusalem, killed millions of Jews, torn down the temple, and exiled the rest"], ["10:25", " of the remaining survivors out of the land, and that was God's punishment upon the nation"], ["10:30", " of Israel for rejecting the Messiah."], ["10:33", " Jesus prophesied, that was good to happen, he wept over the city, remember when he came"], ["10:38", " in?"], ["10:39", " He wept over the city, and he prophesied, \"You see this bricks here?"], ["10:42", " I tell you, not one of these is going to remain upon another.\""], ["10:47", " But since the Christians had already fled Jerusalem, because of the persecution, the church"], ["10:52", " was spared, and they dispersed all throughout the Roman Empire, and with them they took"], ["10:57", " the gospel."], ["10:58", " They took the gospel, and the church grew, and the gospel was so very popular in the"], ["11:06", " Roman Empire, especially in the city of Rome."], ["11:09", " Why?"], ["11:10", " Well, think about it, a huge percentage of the population in Rome were slaves, and since"], ["11:17", " Rome had conquered the world, and it brought all these conquered people back to Rome and"], ["11:24", " made them slaves, the empire was teeming with downtrodden people who had no status or"], ["11:31", " in society, and they had no hope for the future, Jesus had commissioned His followers"], ["11:35", " to make disciples of all nations, and in Rome, where people from all nations, and so"], ["11:42", " they delivered the gospel to these needy people, also, in

leader."], ["12:23", " Why?"], ["12:24", " Well, because it wasn't about money that you became a leader in church, it was because"], ["12:27", " of faith and because of character."], ["12:30", " But

to remember that today because America parallels Rome in many ways,"], ["13:04", " and one of the ways is the number of people from other parts of the world who have been"], ["13:08", " drawn to

The Amorites and the Philistines had gave them a lot of trouble."], ["07:04", " So instead of trusting the Lord and conquering the land as they were commanded to do,"], ["07:08", " they set out spies to find another area. In the north, the Danites learned of an area"], ["07:14", " inhabited by a peaceful group of people whom the Danites proceeded to wipe out. And they"], ["07:21", " moved the entire tribe up to that region and there they established their main city,"], ["07:27", " their capital city, which they called Dan. Another time in Judges, Deborah, the judge"], ["07:35", " Deborah spoke of Dan. The tribe is being detached from the rest of the nation in its time"], ["07:40", " and need, more focused on their ships and neglecting their duty to come to the other tribes"], ["07:44", " in defense of the nation. In Judges chapter 18, there is a story. This whole chapter"], ["07:50", " tells the story of the people of Dan falling into gross idolatry, believing in idols"], ["07:56", " and superstitions. And then later on, in the time of the kings, when the nation was divided,"], ["08:01", " you know, when we had David and then Solomon and then Solomon's son, who is that guy?"], ["08:07", " Jacobome, and he split the nation because of his arrogance. And then the king for the north was"], ["08:15", " rhymes with rainbow. Jerobo, that was easy."], ["08:18", " Rainbow and Jeroboam, when the northern tribes established a kingdom up north, King Jeroboam"], ["08:25", " had two pagan worship centers. He put one in the city of Bethel and the other in the city"], ["08:30", " of, you guessed it, Dan."], ["08:34", " But what we see with this tribe is a pattern of perpetual disobedience, even the one judge"], ["08:40", " they had, Samson, come on. I mean, that's one of the most notorious, lead disobedient"], ["08:48", " people to God. Thus, the tribe of Dan are most like the serpent, and this is something"], ["08:56", " to reflect upon. Because as the old saying goes, our actions speak louder than our"], ["09:03", " words. We can say we are a Christian, a follower of Jesus. We can pray and profess faith"], ["09:10", " and say, thank God and God bless you and God bless America. But our actions speak louder"], ["09:17", " than our words. It is all well and good to speak of loving God and singing worship songs,"], ["09:26", " but when it comes time to actually practice the faith, you know, things like love your"], ["09:30", " neighbor and love your enemies. And for him, those who have sinned against you, who have"], ["09:36", " offended you, be humble, confess your sins, resolve offenses, turn the other cheek, serve"], ["09:42", " people, seems to me that many professing Christians, the extent of their acts of faith is,"], ["09:53", " I attend a church, I practice my faith by attending church most Sundays, I sit respectfully,"], ["10:02", " I listen, and then I take communion. And that's the full extent of their application"], ["10:08", " of their profession of faith in Jesus, treating people with love and serving people in"], ["10:12", " need, proclaiming the gospel, be willing to forgive offenses and be humble enough to"], ["10:17", " admit when you hurt people and seek reconciliation, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's too much."], ["10:23", " I said, I will attend and politely listen. That's how I practice my faith. Don't expect"], ["10:30", " much more than that. Kind of like the tribe of Dan. We're in the nation. I'm really not"], ["10:35", " into this whole obey all the laws of God stuff. So what happened? Judgment. The 10 northern"], ["10:44", " tribes were judged by God when the Assyrians overthrew that part of the land, remnants"], ["10:50", " of all those tribes from the north migrated down to the southern tribes and they were judged"], ["10:56", " again when the southern kingdom was overthrown by the Babylonians. So Dan suffered another"], ["11:01", " round of judgments. That's, you know, kind of like when people from the state of California"], ["11:08", " vote a bunch of politicians in with really bad policies and ruin their state, make it"], ["11:12", " so I'm livable that then they move to another state, but they voted a bunch of politicians"], ["11:18", " that have the same bad policies and repeat the mistake and destroy another state and"], ["11:22", " suffer the same consequences. The adulterous northern Israelites lost their land, migrated"], ["11:29", " south, didn't learn their lesson, repeated the idolatry and suffered the same fate. And"], ["11:35", " they suffered it again after the nation rejected the Messiah in 70 AD when Rome came in"], ["11:41", " and destroyed the whole nation. And that's three times that the Danites were punished"], ["11:46", " for rejecting God. So I would conclude the reason why there's no ceiling of the tribe"], ["11:52", " of Dan is because they are under an even harsher curse than the rest of the nation since"], ["11:59", " they have led in disobedience in idolatry at every stage of their existence. They are not"], ["12:06", " going to be protected during the tribulation and they will suffer more than any other tribe."], ["12:11", " They are the serpent tribe who is under the wrath of God more so than the rest. However,"], ["12:19", " we see according to Ezekiel 48, once the millennial kingdom is established, the tribe"], ["12:24", " of Dan will be given a portion of land and God in the end redeems all of Israel as"], ["12:31", " he keeps his covenant. So there you go. That's the answer to the question. Why is Dan not"], ["12:37", " sealed? Now, this whole ceiling thing. What is this all about? God sealing his people."], ["12:44", " What is that? Well, it's a picture of protection, security, ownership and preservation."], ["12:51", " This ceiling is specifically for the Israelites in the great tribulation.

First of all, there was a prayer to a false God by a devote Sheik Lady. Sheikism"], ["22:07", " is an eastern religion that originated from India. It's a blend.

No problem with that."], ["22:39", " But once she started to pray and all the quote-unquote Christians bowed their heads and folded"], ["22:46", " their hands, they violated the Word of God. Seats don't believe in Jesus. They don't believe"], ["22:56", " that you come to God by faith in Jesus. They come to God based on their own good works."], ["23:03", " They devoutly practice the tenets of their faith. Their prayers are made to wahi guru,"], ["23:08", " not the name of Jesus, but the RNC promoted and bowed and prayed with her to wahi guru."], ["23:17", " God is not into syncretism. Syncretism is the reconciliation or fusion of different systems of belief."], ["23:27", " A popular denomination of that is around America is the universal unitarians."], ["23:34", " All faith is good. Everything leads to God. So that cannot be reconciled with biblical"], ["23:42", " Christianity. You remembered the Ten Commandments, right? The Ten Commandments, that the state"], ["23:49", " of Louisiana mandated be posted at all the public schools, similar mandates have been made in"], ["23:53", " Mississippi and South Carolina and West Virginia, Oklahoma, Utah and Texas, and this proves that we"], ["23:58", " are a Christian nation. Well, what's the First Commandments? Thou shalt have no other gods before me,"], ["24:09", " and that's God's opinion about praying to wahi guru. If the one true God is going to be exalted"], ["24:18", " and glorified, you don't pray to other gods. That was the whole big deal of the Old Testament."], ["24:24", " Always was, they would pray to Yahweh and make sacrifices in the temple, and then they would go"], ["24:31", " off to the hills and the groves, and then they would pray and sacrifice to Baal.

Again, nothing wrong with promoting your political party,"], ["25:13", " but I'm making the point that God was being rejected.

Can she and God be exalted at the same time?"], ["25:38", " She is a professing atheist, matter of fact, just a few short months ago.

is Canada because there is nothing in Canada other than trees."], ["27:55", " That's pretty much when you go to Canada you say, oh, there's trees."], ["27:58", " Look at that."], ["27:59", " There's like 340 billion trees and then the Brazilian rainforest is the country with the third most trees."], ["28:05", " If a trillion trees burn up, what happens?"], ["28:09", " Well, the biggest issue is oxygen, right?"], ["28:14", " The plants make the oxygen that we need to breathe."], ["28:17", " So, let's cut off our air supply."], ["28:21", " Also, we build everything with trees, don't we?"],

anybody go to New York during COVID?"], ["28:36", " Anybody?"], ["28:37", " I did."], ["28:38", " And you know what they did in New York?"], ["28:40", " Because they said you can't go to restaurants, you can't eat inside, but you could legally eat outside."], ["28:47", " So, you know what they did?"], ["28:48", " They built on the streets."], ["28:50", " They built patios."], ["28:53", " And then they, because it came winter, they enclosed them."], ["28:57", " And everyone was allowed to eat inside the patios that were outside that were enclosed."], ["29:05", " But you could need inside."], ["29:07", " I don't know, it was crazy."], ["29:10", " But that's why lumber got so expensive because there was so much demand,"], ["29:14", " because everybody was building outside inside restaurants on the street."], ["29:20", " That's New York for you."], ["29:22", " Great wisdom there."], ["29:25", " So, imagine, that was just a high demand."], ["29:29", " Can you imagine what would happen if there was a shortage, a trillion trees burned up?"], ["29:35", " How much would be the price of lumber then?"], ["29:38", " Also, there's this thing that we call biofuels."], ["29:43", " You know,

do we use grass for?"], ["30:16", " Pastures, right?"], ["30:17", " All of the herds eat the green grass."], ["30:20", " That means a big portion of our food supply is going to starve to death."],

creatures die."], ["30:43", " And a third of the ships are destroyed."], ["30:45", " So, a third of the sea is destroyed."], ["30:47", " Something like a burning mountain, maybe a meteorite hits the Pacific Ocean."], ["30:51", " And what happens if a third of the marine life dies?"], ["30:54", " Well, that's another hit on our food supplies, right?"], ["30:59", " Much of our food comes from the

source."], ["31:17", " You've already lost the livestock's dying because there's no grass."], ["31:20", " Now you're losing all your ocean, a third of your sea life is killed."], ["31:25", " And then there's already this huge amount of inflation from the previous seals."], ["31:33", " Now, we've got no food."], ["31:35", " And then it says that the ships are destroyed."], ["31:39", " You remember, once again, back in COVID, when the ships were all backed up in the Pacific Ocean,"], ["31:43", " because the ports were closed because they couldn't open it up."], ["31:47", " And everything that we were buying, we shipped across from Asia was stuck."], ["31:51", " Remember, the ships all lined up, they were all stuck out there in the Pacific Ocean."], ["31:56", " And we never really thought about our supply chains until that happened."], ["32:01", " I'm really like, ooh, wow."], ["32:02", " We're really export dependents."], ["32:04", " Imagine if a third of those ships are destroyed."], ["32:07", " I mean, our economy is just going to be in complete chaos."], ["32:10", " Then the third trumpet, the angel sounds, and a great star falls from heaven."], ["32:16", " Like a burning torch, and it falls on a third of the waters and the spring waters."], ["32:20", " And it's called wormwood, which is bitter, and it's poisonous."], ["32:25", " So it's destroying the fresh water, which you need water to drink, to survive."], ["32:31", " And I was speculating, well, where do you get a third?"], ["32:34", " Where does it hit when you get like a third?"], ["32:36", " And I was thinking, maybe that's the Great Lakes, because one-fourth of all the fresh water in the world."], ["32:41", " 20% of all the fresh water in the world is in the Great Lakes."], ["32:43", " And that's not even talking about all the river systems that flow in and out of the Great Lakes."], ["32:49", " All the most of the biggest cities in Canada are on the Great Lakes from the St. Lawrence River,"],

about Hamilton or anything like that."], ["33:08", " But then all of the American, there's so many big American cities."], ["33:11", " What's on the Great Lakes?"], ["33:13", " Detroit, Chicago, Milwaukee, Duluth, that's a big one, right?"], ["33:19", " Green Bay."], ["33:21", " No, there is like 60 million people that live in that part of the world."], ["33:26", " And God just cut off the water."], ["33:31", " That's how you evict squatters."], ["33:34", " You take away the things they need to live in your place."], ["33:37", " And then it cuts off the lights with the fourth trumpet."], ["33:43", " The sun, the moon and the stars, a third of them are darkened, so a day and the night."], ["33:50", " I thought it was interesting because, you know, the boogeyman being used to manipulate the masses into more taxes and global governance is the threat of climate change."], ["33:59", " Well, none of these things can be blamed on climate change."], ["34:03", " Darkening the sun, the moon, the stars, that's beyond anything mankind could be blamed of doing."], ["34:09", " It's obvious."], ["34:10", " It's an act of God."], ["34:12", " And we're relying more and more on

to be physically and psychologically damaging events."], ["34:38", " Because a lack of vitamin D causes depression."], ["34:41", " Up north in the northern part of Canada during the winter, they don't actually get light for months."], ["34:48", " And the depression and the suicide rates are so high in that time of the year."], ["34:52", " So, how bad is this going to be in the Great Depression with months of darkness coupled with the smoke from a trillion trees being burned up?"], ["34:59", " Coupled with the scarcity of food and water, coupled with lower oxygen levels."], ["35:07", " Here's what I want you to understand today."], ["35:11", " Everything you need to live comes from God."], ["35:17", " Everything you need to live and survive comes from God."], ["35:22", " He is the author

But according to chapter nine in the"], ["00:42", " future, a particular type of creatures from the abyss will be released into our"], ["00:47", " physical world. Now here this week chapter 10 we contemplate the other side, the"], ["00:52", " other spiritual beings. Let's look at this great angel chapter 10 verses 1"], ["00:57", " through 7, and still another mighty angel coming down from heaven, clothed with"], ["01:03", " the cloud, with the rainbow on his head, face like the sun, feet like color of"], ["01:07", " fire, had a little book in his hands. So we see in that description very"], ["01:12", " similar to descriptions we've seen of angels and heavenly beings, Jesus"], ["01:18", " himself described very similar to that with this book in his hands. And he said"], ["01:25", " his right foot on the sea and he put his right foot on left foot on the land and"], ["01:28", " he cried with the loud voice as when a lion roars and when he cried out seven"], ["01:35", " thunders uttered their voices. Now when the seven thunders uttered their"], ["01:41", " voices I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying to me,"], ["01:45", " seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, do not write them. The angel"], ["01:51", " whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his hand to heaven and"], ["01:55", " swore by him who lives forever and ever who created heaven and the things"], ["01:59", " that are in it and the earth and the things are in it, the sea and the things"], ["02:02", " are in it, that there should be no delay, there should be delay no longer, but in"], ["02:08", " the days of the sounding of the seventh angel when he is above the sound the"], ["02:12", " mystery of God would be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets."], ["02:21", " All right. Something we don't know is how often angels are down here on earth."], ["02:28", " All throughout scripture angels are sent to earth with messages. They appear"], ["02:33", " when God want them to speak to people. They break into the physical world"], ["02:37", " phase in and out of it. Jesus himself when he was resurrected. He did that"], ["02:41", " several times. You remember he's like appeared in the upper room and then he"], ["02:43", " was gone and he appeared up the Sea of Galilee and then he was gone. Elisha he had"], ["02:50", " the eyes to see spiritual realms that most of us cannot see. Look at second"], ["02:57", " kings chapter six. We're going to bounce around a lot today. It'll be all over"], ["03:02", " the place just to make these observations and the texts that apply to chapter"], ["03:08", " ten. Second Kings chapter six verse number eight and we have this very"], ["03:14", " interesting story. So the king of Syria was making war against Israel and as"], ["03:20", " much as things change they stay the same. Don't they? Here's the king of Syria"], ["03:24", " making war with Israel and he consulted his servants saying my camp will be in"], ["03:30", " such and such a place and the man of God sent to the king of Israel saying"], ["03:37", " beware that you don't pass in this place for the Syrians are coming down"], ["03:40", " there. Then the king of Israel sent someone to the place in which the man of God"], ["03:44", " had told them. Thus he warned him and he was watchful there not just once or twice."], ["03:49", " So you see what's happening there every time the Syrians plan something. Elisha"], ["03:54", " warns the king of Israel because he knows. Verse number 11. The heart of the"], ["04:01", " king of Syria was greatly troubled by these things. He called his servants and he"], ["04:04", " said to them. Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?"], ["04:09", " He thinks he's got a spy. One of the servants said. Now none my Lord. O King, but"], ["04:14", " Elisha the prophet who's in Israel tells the king of Israel the words that you"], ["04:19", " speak in your bedroom. So he said go and see where he is and I may send and get"], ["04:27", " him and they told him. Well surely he's in Dotham. Therefore he said horses"], ["04:31", " and chariots in a great army there and they came by night surrounded the city"], ["04:35", " and when the servant of the man of God rose early and went out there was an"], ["04:40", " army surrounding the city with horses and chariots and his servant said"], ["04:44", " \"Alas my master what shall we do?\" and he answered do not fear. Those who are"], ["04:50", " with us are more than those who are with them. And Elisha prayed and he said"], ["04:55", " \"Lord I pray open his eyes that he may see then the Lord open the eyes of the"], ["05:01", " young man and he saw him behold the mountain was full of the horses, chariots"], ["05:06", " of fire around Elisha.\" That's a weird story. Seems like God wants us to know"], ["05:14", " that there are angels out there. We just don't see them. He doesn't want us to"], ["05:20", " fixate on them. Just as their team is lurking around we know angels are watching"], ["05:26", " over us. Matter of fact Jesus told us this in Matthew chapter 18 setting this up. He"], ["05:31", " called a little child and placed a child in front of them and said truly I say"], ["05:35", " unto you unless you change and become a little children you'll never enter the"], ["05:38", " kingdom of heaven. Therefore whoever takes the lowly position of a child is"], ["05:42", " greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoever welcomes such a child in my name"], ["05:47", " welcomes me. Verse number 10 he elaborates see that you do not despise one of"], ["05:52", " these little ones for I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the"], ["05:58", " face of my father in heaven. So this passage shows us how much importance"], ["06:03", " Jesus places on children even to the point to reveal to us that they have"], ["06:08", " angels that have an audience with God. Children are vulnerable they're very"], ["06:14", " susceptible to all sorts of calamity. Thankfully according to Jesus it seems"], ["06:20", " like there are angels keeping an eye on them. I think many of us have had"], ["06:25", " close calls right. I've had near misses with head on collisions with snow"], ["06:30", " plows, electrocution, potential, drowning. If you have had a near miss a brush"], ["06:38", " with death you know your life with spare. Raise your hand. Nice and high look"], ["06:42", " at that. Well it looks like the guardian angels have been very busy with the"], ["06:47", " congregation here this morning, haven't they? Also we know of how many times"], ["06:52", " that we never know of how many times we were delayed or distracted so we would"], ["06:57", " not be in the place where tragedy is struck right. We don't even think or no"], ["07:01", " of all those instances but we hear occasionally testimonies or accounts of"], ["07:06", " people who said you know I was supposed to be in the the Twin Towers in 9/11."], ["07:10", " I was delayed from going to work. People know they were supposed to be in a set"], ["07:15", " location but then tragedy struck there but they missed that somehow. What"], ["07:20", " luck? Is it luck? Is it coincidence? Or is it as the psalmist said in Psalms 34"], ["07:26", " 7, \"The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him to deliver him.\" So"], ["07:33", " that's another good reason to trust in the Lord, right? He protects angelic. He"], ["07:39", " provides angelic protection for us and the qualifying factor those who fear the"], ["07:45", " Lord. People who deny God do not have the same level of protection as the"], ["07:49", " child of God and Jesus taught us to pray in the Lord's prayer deliver us from"], ["07:56", " evil. You can pray that every day. You can ask for God's blessing and deliverance"], ["08:02", " from evil every day. Do you? You don't. Why not? The hymns of that old song. That"], ["08:11", " the words that old hymn. What a friend we have in Jesus. All of our sins and"], ["08:17", " griefs to bear. What a privilege it is to carry everything to God and prayer."], ["08:21", " Oh what peace we often forfeit. Oh what needless pain we bear. All because we do"], ["08:27", " not carry everything to God and prayer. James said you have not kazia. You ask"], ["08:35", " not. Why will people ask for that help protection for deliverance? Maybe they"], ["08:41", " don't believe they can. Maybe they're just too stubborn. Maybe they just don't"], ["08:46", " know. Well I want to enlighten you that God loves you and he's willing to answer"], ["08:53", " your prayers. Scripture says draw night a God and he will draw night to you. Well I"], ["09:00", " watch the news and I see tragedy striking people every day. It's pretty obvious"], ["09:04", " that chaos is always just outside the door and yet I do not fear life because the"], ["09:11", " angel of the Lord and camps around those who fear him. I'm protected and God"], ["09:17", " is sovereign over our lives. He points the days. He knows exactly the amount of"], ["09:24", " days that we're supposed to have. He says in Psalms 139 your eyes saw my"], ["09:29", " unformed substance. In your book we're written. Every one of them the days"], ["09:35", " that were formed for me. I think this is vital for us to understand because"], ["09:40", " so many people are plagued with fear. You know and all that demon stuff last"], ["09:44", " week it might have seemed like oh that's just a scare tactic to get you to"], ["09:48", " you know get people into church and believe in Jesus. Well yes and no if you"], ["09:54", " don't trust in the Lord you do have reasons to be afraid but if you're"], ["09:58", " trusting in the Lord you have no reason for fear. You don't need to worry or be"], ["10:03", " anxious like that Chris Tomlin song that we used to sing. I know who goes"], ["10:10", " before me. I know who stands behind the God of angel armies is always by my"], ["10:16", " side. And nothing formed against me shall stand. He holds the whole world in his"], ["10:21", " hands. I'm holding on to his promises because he is faithful. Is revelation a"], ["10:29", " dreadful sounding book for those who reject God it is for those who trust in the"], ["10:35", " Lord it is not. It's a book that reveals to us much of who God is and what is"], ["10:41", " happening and why it's happening. We know the future. So here in chapter 10 we"], ["10:48", " have yet another supernatural event this mighty angel. But you know there"], ["10:54", " is a bit of a mystery behind the action here. It was kind of an odd one to"], ["11:00", " explain to you today. He comes down. The way he's described. He's got this little"], ["11:06", " book and then he puts his foot on the right right foot on the which one. See"], ["11:12", " left foot on the land. Crime of the loud voice like our lion roaring seven"], ["11:17", " thunders are uttered. So John goes to write the seven thunders and then all"], ["11:22", " of a sudden the message seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered. Do not"], ["11:27", " write them. What's that mean? What's going on? What are these seven thunders? We"], ["11:32", " had seven seals that turned into seven trumpets and then we get seven thunders"], ["11:37", " that's consistent with the pattern probably there. Judgments but then he says"], ["11:42", " seal them up. Don't tell. So why? Well there's speculations but it is foolish to"], ["11:49", " make any hard and fast declarations about these seven thunders because God told"], ["11:53", " John to seal them up. Don't write them which means I think one of two things means"], ["12:00", " either one they're going to happen but we don't know about them. We're going to"], ["12:06", " find out when they happen or they are sealed meaning God is not permitting them"], ["12:12", " to happen since it is the book of Revelation revealing stuff and it has"], ["12:19", " already been so shocking what God is going to do. It doesn't make sense to me"], ["12:23", " that these are seven judgments that God's planning but he doesn't want to"], ["12:27", " tell us about them. No I think they are sealed because God is decided to not"], ["12:33", " release them. He's holding these judgments back because even in judgment God"], ["12:40", " is merciful. Even in pouring out wrath he's not as harsh as he could be. He's"], ["12:46", " communicating that as bad as things may sound the disasters the demons and"], ["12:52", " death a half of the world's population it's not as worse. He has another whole"], ["12:58", " level of wrath that he's withholding and I think that's consistent with his"], ["13:02", " character. Even in wrath we see God's mercy. In the midst of learning the future"], ["13:08", " in all what is going to happen I don't want you to forget the why. Why is God"], ["13:14", " unleashing the seven seal judgments that open up the seven trumpet"], ["13:21", " judgments that will eventually open up not the thunders but then seven more"], ["13:26", " bold judgments that are coming and just to remind you refresh your memory why"], ["13:30", " Revelation chapter six verse number nine the fifth seal and open up the fifth"], ["13:35", " seal under the altar with the souls of those who are slain for the word of God"], ["13:39", " for the testimony which they held chapter seven verse number nine it says after"], ["13:51", " these things I looked and behold a great multitude which no one could"], ["13:54", " number of all the nation's tribes people tongues standing before the throne"], ["13:58", " clothed in white robes palm branch in hand crime of the loud voice salvation"], ["14:03", " to our God into the lamb and then one of the elders said you know who these"], ["14:08", " guys are and John's like verse 14 sir you know and he said these

["14:32", " the reason for the wrath of God first of all is people who had not accepted the"], ["14:39", " gift of salvation but once the wrath starts multitudes cry out for salvation once"], ["14:47", " this seven year tribulation starts people are getting saved the wrath humbles"], ["14:53", " people and here's the second reason for the wrath as we saw last week chapter"], ["14:57", " nine verse number 20 well we're going through those trumpets we saw the first"], ["15:03", " four trumpets verse number 20 the rest of mankind even though they had the the"], ["15:08", " demons poured

there's sexual"], ["15:39", " immorality or their threats so the reason the second reason for the wrath is"], ["15:45", " first reason there's a bunch of people they get saved because of the wrath they"], ["15:49", " fall on their faces and cry out and the second reason is for the rest of"], ["15:53", " humanity they completely reject God they completely reject to the gospel the"], ["15:58", "

["18:14", " people have to decide which wrath is worse the devil's wrath or God's wrath"], ["18:21", " and Jesus gives us some sound reasoning that we ought to employ when we make"], ["18:27", " our

It's been given to the Gentiles and they will tread the Holy City underfoot for"], ["29:19", " 42 months. What does this act of measuring mean? Well, we go to Scripture, let me see in"], ["29:28", " Samuel chapter 2, 8 verse 2, then he defeated Moab, forcing them down to the ground and"], ["29:34", " he measured them off with a line. With two lines he measured off, those who he'd be put"], ["29:40", " to death and with one full line, those who'd be kept alive.

Jesus"], ["29:59", " said in Matthew chapter 7, for the judgment you pronounce, it will be judged and for the"], ["30:03", " measure that you use, it will be measured to you. Second Kings chapter 21. And I will stretch"], ["30:10", " out over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plumblet of the house of Ahab."], ["30:17", " And I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down."], ["30:24", " Ahab is chapter 7, verses 7 through 9, verse 17. Thus he showed me, behold, the Lord stood on a wall and made a plumb line."], ["30:33", " And with the plumb line in his hand, the Lord's ass said to me, Amos, what do you see? And I said,"], ["30:39", " a plumb line. And then the Lord said, behold, I'm setting a plumb line in the midst of"], ["30:45", " my people Israel. I will not pass by them anymore. The high places of Isaac will be desolate,"], ["30:51", " the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste. I will rise with the sword against the hosts of"], ["30:56", " Jeroboam.

Your land shall be divided by a surveying line measured and"], ["31:06", " divided. You shall die in a defiled land. Israel will surely be led in the way to captivity"], ["31:13", " from its own land. So why is this newly built temple during the tribulation being measured"], ["31:20", " out? Worship at this temple by the Jews will not be worship of Jesus. Worship that takes"], ["31:27", " place in this temple will not be honoring to God. Instead, this temple will be a bargaining"], ["31:33", " chip used by the Antichrist to bring world peace at the start of the seven year tribulation."], ["31:38", " He will broker a deal and the Muslims will get to keep their dome of the rock and Israel will"], ["31:43", " get to build their temple. Verse 2 tells us, build the temple, measure the temple, but leave out"], ["31:49", " the court that is outside the temple. Don't measure it. It's been given to the Gentiles to be"], ["31:53", " tried under the holy city underfoot for 42 months. So that's outside the outer court. And this"], ["32:03", " right here is a model.

The little building in the middle is actually the temple"], ["32:17", " proper and all of the walls and all of the outer court area is what's called the outer court and"], ["32:23", " the temple mount proper is all of that. So originally the whole big complex was called the temple."], ["32:31", " Here in Revelation chapter 11, the prophecy says that the outer courts, that outer wall thing"], ["32:38", " is going to be given to the Gentiles. And this is, next slide, is an artistic"], ["32:45", " interpretation of what the temple mount would look like if the Muslims and the Jews"], ["32:51", " shared the space that the Muslims get to keep the dome of the rock and Israel gets to build"], ["32:57", " their temple mount on that whole area. This is what the Jews are asking for and this is what"], ["33:03", " Revelation chapter 11 is describing.

Daniel chapter 12 verse 11, from the time"], ["34:01", " that the regular sacrifices abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will"], ["34:05", " be 1,290 days, that's three and a half years, 42 months, that is handed over to the Gentiles."], ["34:14", " Well, I didn't say anything about setting himself up to be worship, just said abomination of"], ["34:18", " desolation, that's kind of cryptic pastor up, right. But Paul revealed to us that detail in second"], ["34:24", " Thessalonians chapter two, where he said let no one deceive you will be any needs for that day,"], ["34:29", " will not come until the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of"], ["34:33", " perdition, those are another words, titles we use for the Antichrist, who exalts himself above all"], ["34:39", " that is called God or that is worship, so that he sits as God where?

So yes, there's another prophecy, as Daniel said, as Jesus said,"], ["34:54", " as John said, the temple will rebuke, be rebuilt, that is the decree will of God, that is"], ["35:01", " prophecy fulfilled.

John starts telling us some action that takes place on the earth"], ["07:22", " at the beginning and during the seven years of tribulation. How do I know the timeline?"], ["07:27", " Well, because of what we learned two weeks ago, Revelation chapter 11 verse one,"], ["07:31", " I was given a read like a measuring rod in the angel's students saying rise and measure the"], ["07:35", " temple of God, the altar and those who worship there, but leave out the court which is outside the"], ["07:40", " temple and do not measure it for it has been given to the Gentiles and they will tread the holy"], ["07:45", " city under foot for 42 months. 42 months is three and a half years, right? This scenario where the"], ["07:59", " temple is in Jerusalem, but the outer court is controlled by the Gentiles for 42 months is the first"], ["08:07", " half of the tribulation. And at the same time that there's this temple in Jerusalem,"], ["08:12", " we read chapter, chapter 11 verse three and I will give power to my two witnesses and a conjunction"], ["08:21", " used here to introduce an additional subject to the scene. At the temple, this is happening"], ["08:28", " and I give power to these two witnesses first number three and they prophesied for 1,260 days"], ["08:38", " and how long is that? 42 months, 42 Jewish months which is three and a half years. So all during"], ["08:47", " the first half of the seven year tribulation, these two witnesses with the power of God are prophesying"], ["08:54", " in Jerusalem and they're clothed in sackcloth, why? People wore sackcloth in the Old Testament"], ["09:01", " when they wanted to what? Repent and mourn and beg God for forgiveness and deliverance. I just"], ["09:10", " rehashed all the judgments that God was pouring out on the earth during this time. But we learned"], ["09:18", " in Revelation chapter 9, displayed all of that, the rest of mankind who were not killed by these"], ["09:23", " plagues did not repent of the works of their hands that they should worship demons and idols of gold"], ["09:28", " and silver brass stone and wood, which neither seen nor here in or walk and they did not repent of"], ["09:34", " their murders or their sorceries or their sexual their rallies or their thefts. People are not"], ["09:41", " getting the message. Well, maybe people are confused. They don't understand what all these judgments"], ["09:49", " are for. Maybe they just think it's climate change or natural disasters. Maybe no way is explaining"], ["09:56", " all these warning signs in what they mean. Well, God's not going to allow anyone to have that excuse,"], ["10:03", " he has two witnesses at the very beginning of the great tribulation, explaining what is happening"], ["10:10", " and why. The term witness is the Greek word, Martois, means one who gives their account,"], ["10:19", " who speaks what they have seen and experienced. Acts chapter 1 verse number 8, Jesus said to his"], ["10:24", " disciples, you shall receive power when the Holy Ghost comes upon you and you will be my"], ["10:30", " Martois, my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaritan, the ends of the earth and we say that is"], ["10:36", " our great, the great commission. Jesus witnesses the disciples and many of his followers in the"], ["10:44", " first century were all put to death for doing that, for sharing the gospel. So the Greek word,"], ["10:50", " Martois became the English word martyr, which we say we use that when someone is killed for what"], ["10:58", " they believe and these two witnesses here in Revelation 11, they will be killed as we already read"], ["11:03", " for their message. They have many enemies because they are telling the world why these judgments"], ["11:09", " are happening. They're explaining why the famines and why third of the plant, plant life destroyed"], ["11:14", " and why we the third of the fresh water and why third of the oceans and why four billion people"], ["11:18", " are being killed, why? Because you do not repent of your sins. Because you have rejected God's"], ["11:25", " salvation and you refuse to receive Jesus Christ, your disobeying His word and He's pouring on His"], ["11:31", " wrath, repent, repent, repent. And that's what they preach. For 1,260 days, don't think about that"], ["11:40", " for a moment. As we covered two weeks ago and I'm sure you all remember, you know, you watch the"], ["11:45", " video to get ready for this morning. It's you're so excited about learning this. Somebody said,"], ["11:50", " yes, Deb did. Nobody else did. Think about this. Two weeks ago, the temple being built in Jerusalem."], ["11:56", " We said it's supposed to be a place, a place of prayer, a place for people to come to God."], ["12:02", " They say it's a place for all people of all faiths. In the Jews, we're so excited to get their"], ["12:08", " temple. The Antichrist who brokered the whole peace treaty saying, okay, Muslims are going to keep"], ["12:15", " their dome of the rock and they'll have their holy sight and the Jews are going to have their"], ["12:18", " holy sight and everyone's worshiping God. So what's the problem? Like I said last week, a new temple"], ["12:27", " is not the way to God. Sacrificing animals in Jerusalem, reinstating the old"], ["12:33", " Testament, Mosaic laws is not coming to God. It's just the opposite. It is all the rejection of"], ["12:41", " Jesus, the Lamb of God and His sacrifice and everything that's being done on that temple mount"], ["12:48", " by the Jews and by the Muslims and by whatever other religion is worshiping up there is not"], ["12:54", " acceptable in God's sight. Matter of fact, all that they're doing up there, the two witnesses"], ["12:59", " are telling them repentance, repenting your false religion and turn to Jesus. So let's"], ["13:06", " think about that for a moment. Israel after 1900 years finally gets their temple back to them."], ["13:14", " It seems like a miracle. It's an answer to prayer. It's a dream come true. The whole world is"], ["13:20", " so relieved, right? Because at long last there's peace in the Middle East, like even today we're just"], ["13:27", " looking at what's going on in Israel and we're always worrying and concerned about all the fighting"], ["13:31", " over there. And now it's a big peace treaty and everyone's happy. Yay! All need to have these two"], ["13:38", " prophets show up and start telling everyone you're wrong, you're religion's wrong, you're holy"], ["13:43", " sites, you're temples, they're all abominations and God is bringing all these curses on the earth"], ["13:48", " because of everyone's disobedience. How's that going over? Everything we just accomplished"], ["13:55", " our finest hour of peace and you two guys are telling us to repent that God's angry at us? Would"], ["14:01", " you just go away? Imagine if someone came in here and stood up in the middle of our service"], ["14:08", " and told us how unacceptable our worship service is and that drum cage that's just an abomination,"], ["14:15", " should get rid of that. And you know, Pastor Rob is just, you know, he's offensive and he's doing"], ["14:21", " this heretical preaching. What would we think? Well, we probably hear a little squawking in the"], ["14:27", " walkie talkies. Security. Code red, sanctuary. You can see the big old security guys, you know, come in."], ["14:36", " There would be an immediate reaction from all of us. These guys up here on the temple mount"], ["14:43", " telling everyone to repent. We need to get these cukes out of here. So they send people to arrest"], ["14:49", " them. But when they do, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. They have the"], ["14:56", " power to impact reality with their mere words. That's the power of God, right? God spoke the world"], ["15:07", " into existence by his word. He said, let there be lights and there was light. Let there be"], ["15:15", " water. Let there be land, trees, animals. God spoke the world into existence. And Jesus likewise"], ["15:25", " spoke and the miracles happen. Rise, take up your bed and walk. Demon come out of her. Storm, peace,"], ["15:33", " be still Lazarus. Come forth. Jesus spoke and it impacted reality. And these two witnesses,"], ["15:43", " they have that power of God. Verse number six, they have the power to shut heaven so that no rain"], ["15:53", " falls in the name of their prophecy, in the days of their prophecies. They have power over water"], ["15:57", " to turn them to blood and to strike the earth with all plagues as often as they desire. Oh,"], ["16:03", " that's, that's wild. That's unheard of. Ah, no. Actually, that's the same stuff. Moses and Elijah"], ["16:14", " were doing in the Old Testament. And that is a very real possibility of who these two witnesses"], ["16:20", " are. Moses and Elijah. Matter of fact, nobody disagrees that it's Elijah because of Malachi, chapter"], ["16:29", " four verse number five, where the prophet said, behold, I'm sending Elijah the prophet before"], ["16:36", " the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. So everybody says, well, one of these guys is"], ["16:41", " Elijah. The debate is really over who the second one is. It gives us a little hint. It says this is"], ["16:47", " the all of branches. The, um, the lamb stands. Well, that's a reference to Zachari as so much of"], ["16:53", " everything in Revelation is found all through the, the Old Testament as Zachariya, the prophet said,"], ["16:59", " I answered and said to him, what are these two olive trees at the right of the lamb stand and it's"], ["17:05", " left? And I further answered and said to him, what are these two olive branches that drip into"], ["17:10", " the receptacles of the gold pipes from which the golden oil drains? And he said to me, do you not"], ["17:17", " know what these are? And I said, no, my Lord. And he said, these are the two anointed ones"], ["17:23", " who stand beside the Lord of the whole earth, the two witnesses, the two anointed ones. Okay,"], ["17:28", " but that doesn't say who they are. Why do we conclude his Moses and Elijah? Well, I think one good"], ["17:35", " reason is just found if you turn to Matthew chapter 17, turn to Matthew chapter 17. And I think"], ["17:42", " this is a good hint. This is the mount of transfiguration. Matthew chapter 17 verse one after the"], ["17:50", " six days, Jesus took Peter, James and John is a brother and led them up to a high mountain by"], ["17:57", " themselves. Matthew 17 verse two. And he was transfigured before them. What does that mean? His"], ["18:04", " face shone like the sun, his clothes became white as the light and behold, who? Moses and Elijah"], ["18:13", " appeared to them talking with him. And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it's good for us"], ["18:18", " to be here. If you wish, tell us we might make three tabernacles, one for you, one for Moses,"], ["18:24", " and one for Elijah. So that's a very interesting piece of advice who appeared. Moses and Elijah"], ["18:33", " witnesses of Jesus ministry on earth. People have observed that Moses, the author of the"], ["18:40", " Pentateuch, the law, and Elijah, a prophet together represents all of the Old Testament,"], ["18:46", " which often is referred to as the law and the prophets. That's what they call the Old Testament."], ["18:53", " They call it the law and the prophets. These two witnesses, they witness the fact that Jesus"], ["19:00", " was fulfilling all the requirements of the law and fulfilling all of the prophecies."], ["19:07", " Also, no other Old Testament saints ever made an appearance in the New Testament. And also,"], ["19:13", " their powers are a clue as to who they are. Verse number five, starting off with that they"], ["19:20", " have fire proceeding out of their mouth and destroying their enemies. And Elijah was able to call"], ["19:26", " fire down from heaven in 1 Kings chapter 18. Moses called down fire and hail on Egypt in one"], ["19:34", " of the plagues. And also, again, in Numbers chapter 11, well, Lord said fire upon the Israelites"], ["19:39", " when they were complaining and rebelling against Moses in the wilderness. Verse number six,"], ["19:43", " they have the power to shut up rain. No rain for three and a half years during this tribulation"], ["19:51", " time. And that's the same thing Elijah did in Israel. Think about how devastating that would be"], ["19:55", " to have no rain for three and a half years. You know, one week in my, my pitiful grass is wilting"], ["20:01", " off. I mentioned three and a half years of no rain. What's that's going to cause? In Elijah's day,"], ["20:07", " King Ahab and Queen Jezebel had all of Israel worshiping Baal, Baal, the storm God, the"], ["20:15", " fertility God of the Canaanites, the God who they said brought the rain for the crops to grow and"], ["20:21", " bless the herd so they could reproduce and this brought food and abundance and wealth to the people."], ["20:28", " So God has a showdown with Baal and Elijah brings the message. God says, no rain. So God was proving"], ["20:38", " who really is the one true God, who really controls the rain and blesses the harvest,"], ["20:44", " not this fake Canaanite Baal God. And Moses in Egypt did the same thing. The 10 plagues were all"], ["20:51", " a direct attack on the gods of Egypt who were supposed to have power over everything, over everything"], ["20:57", " that God was cursing, the Nile and the crops and the animals and all that. We did all that. We showed"], ["21:03", " you that once before you remember. He was proving who is the one true God. So this once again is the"], ["21:09", " scene during the tribulation. God is showing all those who dwell on the earth who rejected his word"], ["21:17", " and even reject his existence because that's exactly what's happened. People have even"], ["21:23", " rejecting his existence for the last hundred years in western civilization. People have been"], ["21:28", " rejecting the very existence of God, atheist, mock and scorn, the concept of God and mock and ridicule"], ["21:35", " people who believe in God. They say, there's no proof of any God. It's all fairy tales. We believe"], ["21:42", " in science, not myths. And that's what we're up against when we try to talk to people about God and"], ["21:48", " eternity and life after death. People just roll their eyes. People have missed all the signs"], ["21:56", " all the signs that God has given them. Have you missed the signs? God reveals himself to us"], ["22:06", " by two means through how general revelation and through specific revelation."], ["22:15", " General revelation turned to Romans chapter 1, verse 18. Romans chapter 1, verse 18."], ["22:24", " \"The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against unongodliness and a righteousness of man who"], ["22:32", " suppressed the truth and unrighteousness because,\" verse 19. \"What may be known of God is manifest to them"], ["22:40", " for God has shown it to them for since the creation of the world his invisible attributes are"], ["22:46", " clearly seen being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God had"], ["22:54", " so that they are without excuse because although they knew God, they did not glory"], ["22:59", " by him as God nor were they thankful but became futile in their thoughts and their foolish"], ["23:05", " hearts were darkened, professing to be wise they became fools. God's invisible attributes"], ["23:14", " clearly seen being understood by the things that are made and the modern day term for that is"], ["23:23", " intelligent design. Scientists have had to come to the conclusion that the big bang is nonsense"], ["23:34", " because life is too complex, too detailed, too intricate. No science supports just jumbling chemicals"], ["23:43", " together and then life just will coincidentally spontaneously up here. Poof, shake it all up. Poof, there it is."], ["23:53", " Someone finds an expensive wristwatch on the beach. They don't conclude, oh this watch it evolved"], ["24:03", " from all the elements that are in the sand and all the metal in all the glass it all just came"], ["24:08", " together in the tides and formed all the intricate gears and pieces and now a watch.

Irreducible complexities."], ["24:51", " Everything is too complex to have happened by time and chance, by evolving, macro evolution,"], ["24:59", " is scientifically impossible and the science community knows this.

The Lord said to Satan, have you considered my servant Job that there is"], ["01:09", " none like him on the earth a blameless and upright man who fears God and"], ["01:15", " sons evil.

The observations we make here can help"], ["02:46", " us understand and interpret Revelation chapter 12. Now turn to Revelation"], ["02:53", " chapter 12 which we started last week. Revelation 12 gives us two signs. These signs"], ["02:59", " summarize for us 4,000 years of Israel's history and if you missed last week"], ["03:05", " sermon I highly recommend you go back and listen to it because I can't"], ["03:09", " rehash all that we unpacked last week but I will do a quick review of the"], ["03:15", " signs for you if you're new here today or you fell asleep last week sermon."], ["03:20", " So a Revelation chapter 12 verse number 1 there was a sign that appeared in"], ["03:24", " heaven. A woman clothed with the sun with the moon at her feet and on her head"], ["03:29", " a garland of 12 stars. She being with child which is common around here but she"], ["03:35", " cried out in labor and in pain to give birth and another sign appeared in"], ["03:40", " heaven. Behold a great fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven"], ["03:45", " diadams on his head. His tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and through"], ["03:51", " them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give"], ["03:56", " birth to devour her child as soon as it was born. She bore a male child who"], ["04:02", " was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up to God"], ["04:08", " in his throne. Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place"], ["04:13", " prepared by God that she should feed that they should feed her there for 1,260"], ["04:22", " days. 4,000 years of Israel's history wrapped up in two signs. Let's see if you"], ["04:32", " remember last week. The woman is Israel. How do we know? Joseph's dream from Genesis"], ["04:39", " chapter 37 where he told his brothers I had a dream that the sun, the moon and the"], ["04:45", " eleven stars bowed down to me and his father Jacob was told to dream and Jacob"], ["04:52", " said what is this dream you've dreamed?

That's how we know that. That is what we're"], ["05:09", " talking about here. The dragon is Satan. How do we know? It's right in the passage."], ["05:15", " It's just good out of verse number nine. It says that great dragon that's"], ["05:18", " serpentable called the devil and Satan. The seven heads of the dragon are the"], ["05:23", " seven empires that Satan has manipulated to destroy the Messiah from being"], ["05:28", " born. How do we know? Well pretty well, most of the Old Testament, specifically"], ["05:33", " the book of Daniel. All seven empires, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece,"], ["05:39", " Rome and one final one that devil used each one to try to destroy the children"], ["05:44", " of Israel to prevent the birth of the Messiah and the child in this is of"], ["05:50", " course Jesus Christ and God's plan is from the nation of Israel. We'll come"], ["05:57", " forth the Messiah who will overthrow all the empires of this world ruled by"], ["06:01", " Satan and set up a kingdom of righteousness in Israel that he will reign from."], ["06:07", " Revelation is declaring to us how God is going to evict Satan in all who follow"], ["06:14", " him the empires of this world controlled by Satan are all squatters and do not"], ["06:20", " have the authority to rule this earth. Jesus is the one with the authority and"], ["06:25", " he will rule and all who trusted him will reign with him. But Satan's not going"], ["06:30", " to go down without a fight. So he's doing everything he can to prevent this"], ["06:35", " revelation from coming true and he just keeps failing. He failed to destroy"], ["06:40", " Israel the nation before the Messiah was born. He failed to stop baby Jesus"], ["06:45", " from being born. He failed to prevent Jesus from performing his purpose for"], ["06:50", " coming to the earth. Actually he aided and assisted Jesus crucifixion inspired by"], ["06:55", " Satan and executed by Rome was what Jesus was planning to do all along and then"], ["07:02", " after he rose again he ascended up into heaven and Satan lost his"], ["07:07", " opportunity. Well all he's got left is to try to stop Israel from being a nation."], ["07:13", " Wipe up the Jews to stop these prophecies. The remaining prophecies from"], ["07:18", " coming true. But he's failed at that for the last 2,000 years. In 1948 Israel"], ["07:24", " became a nation again despite all of his efforts to stop her. Now picking it up"], ["07:29", " where we left off last week let's get into some specific details because all"], ["07:33", " that was review and you knew all that. Okay so verse number six the woman"], ["07:37", " fled to the wilderness where she had a place prepared for her for God to feed"], ["07:42", " her for 1,260 days. A war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with"], ["07:50", " the dragon and the dragon and his angels fought and they did not prevail."], ["07:53", " Nor would they have found a place for them in heaven any longer so the great"], ["07:56", " dragon was cast out the serpent of old called the devil and Satan who"], ["08:01", " deceived the whole world.

and the sea for the"], ["08:34", " devil has come down to you with great wrath because he knows his time is short"], ["08:39", " okay so we see here in verse number six 1,260 days a period of time that is"], ["08:46", " constantly repeated and they they tell you like 1,260 days and then they also"], ["08:51", " say three and a half years and they also say 42 months in the whole thing is"], ["08:57", " telling us about this very specific time it's a time marker to know exactly"], ["09:02", " where we are in this seven year tribulation because Revelation chapter four"], ["09:07", " all the way to Revelation chapter 19 is a period of time that is constantly"], ["09:12", " repeated three and a half years the great tribulation full seven and halfway"], ["09:18", " through that's the that's what the prophet Daniel told us about that at the"], ["09:22", " first half of the seven years a ruler would rise make a peace treaty with"], ["09:26", " Israel but at the midway point he's going to break the treaty and for the"], ["09:31", " last three and a half years things will be very bad for the nation of Israel and"], ["09:36", " Jesus warned us of that time and that event in Matthew chapter 24 when they're"], ["09:41", " asking him about the sub time of the end Jesus says when you see the"], ["09:46", " abomination of desolation spoken by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy"], ["09:51", " place then those who are in Judah flee to the mountains don't go if you're on"], ["09:56", " the house top don't even go to the house to get anything if you're in the field"], ["09:59", " don't come back for any clothes whoa to you if you're pregnant or nursing in"], ["10:02", " those days and pray that it doesn't happen in the winter or on a Sabbath for"], ["10:07", " there will be a time of great tribulation such has not been seen in the world"], ["10:11", " until this time nor ever shall be and unless those days are shortened no flesh"], ["10:16", " would be saved but for the elects sake they will be shortened so this is where"], ["10:21", " we're at this is right where we're at in Revelation chapter 12 Revelation"], ["10:25", " chapter 11 was the first three and a half years the two prophets prophesied"], ["10:30", " they're protected by God but after 42 months they were killed by the beast the"], ["10:34", " antichrist and we will study him in detail next week but here in verse chapter"], ["10:40", " 12 verse number six it's the time for the woman to flee to the wilderness for"], ["10:45", " three and a half years just like Jesus instructed in Matthew chapter 24 but"], ["10:51", " notice God has a place for her to go and hide and be protected so once again"], ["10:57", " just like the last four thousand years of history even though the devil wants to"], ["11:00", " destroy Israel he fails God is protecting his chosen people until the end and we'll"], ["11:07", " see a little bit more on that in a few minutes in verses 3 through 17 but John"], ["11:12", " really focuses in on the action of the dragon and last week we covered how Satan"], ["11:16", " rebelled against God and one third of the angels of heaven followed him"], ["11:20", " that's what it meant in verse number four where it said that he cooked with his"], ["11:24", " tail he was able to draw a third of the stars a third of the angels and throw"], ["11:28", " them down to earth that's quite an accomplishment to get a third of the"], ["11:33", " angels to follow him it's apparent in the Bible that angels like humans have"], ["11:40", " free will we they have mind will and emotions and something about the way that"], ["11:48", " God is orienting his creation doesn't sit well with the portion of the heavenly"], ["11:54", " host what would motivate one third of the angels to rebal well here's the"], ["12:02", " theory maybe they don't like how God is going to elevate humanity over them you"], ["12:10", " remember we learn in Revelation chapter 4 verse 4 there are 24 elders 24 people"], ["12:15", " sitting on the thrones around the throne of God mankind are sitting at the"], ["12:22", " throne of God this is what Paul said in 2nd Timothy chapter 2 this is a"], ["12:27", " faithful say if we die with him we shall live with him if we endure we shall"], ["12:32", " also reign with him if we deny him he denies us and then Paul said in 1st"], ["12:39", " Corinthians chapter 6 do you not know that the saints will judge the world if"], ["12:43", " the world will be judged by you you are you unworthy to judge the smallest"], ["12:47",

and one third of the angels followed him how many angels"], ["13:18", " are there by the way don't know I don't know either scripture just uses"], ["13:24", " like terms like merians merians upon merians 10,000s times 10,000s so just big"], ["13:31", " numbers so let's assume since we kind of have passages that say you know"], ["13:35", " there's angels watching over us there's guardian angels so let's just assume"], ["13:39", " there's one angel per person okay so right now there's eight billion people in"], ["13:44", " the world okay so if one third fall how many's that 2.67 that's a lot two"], ["13:53", " point six seven billion angels went with Lucifer but there's still come on"], ["14:00", " math people five point three three billion who are obedient to God and that"], ["14:06", " comes into play right here in chapter 12 verse number seven a war bro go to"], ["14:12", " heaven Michael and his angels fought with the dragon and the dragon in his"], ["14:15", " angels fought but

in"], ["16:12", " there at some point he thought he could be God and that's when he fell in Jesus"], ["16:17", " saw it so is that revelation 12 is talking about that time maybe however"], ["16:25", " remember that first thing we read at the beginning Job chapter 1 Satan is in"], ["16:33", " heaven presenting himself to God and making accusations so it seems like"], ["16:39", " Satan in Job even

He said, \"Those great beasts which are four are four kings that will rise out of the earth,"], ["11:45", " but the saints in the most high will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever and ever.\""], ["11:51", " I don't know. We'll find a series to watch in the evening when nothing else is going on."], ["11:59", " For me, for her there's always something going on. Since she's working on a doctorate,"], ["12:05", " she often is working while the show is playing in the background, so she's not really paying"], ["12:11", " that close attention to the show, but then something will be revealed in the dialogue that is"], ["12:17", " connected to a previous event, a plot twist of some sort, and she starts asking me questions."], ["12:22", " She realizes that what is happening is pertinent, but she doesn't really catch why because"], ["12:30", " she's not paying that close attention. So in mid-show, I'm trying to keep up with the plot twist"], ["12:36", " and I'm trying to explain to her how this piece of information fits. Does anybody else do that?"], ["12:41", " Some of you are laughing and yes, some of you know exactly what I'm talking."], ["12:45", " It's really not that complicated to understand when one's paying attention, so this is what"], ["12:51", " these symbolic beasts are like. At first glance they seem very complicated, you know, like that was"], ["12:56", " crazy. Why are you reading crazy stuff? But it's not that complicated when you are following"], ["13:03", " the entire biblical narrative. Back when we studied Daniels, they remember Daniel, probably"], ["13:09", " a few people remember Daniel, that was quite a while ago. Kevin, you've been around that long,"], ["13:13", " man, you were just a little guy, little guy in the drums, remember in Daniel. When we studied"], ["13:18", " Daniel, we learned that the four beasts represent four world empires. The lion was, Kevin, you remember,"], ["13:24", " Babylon, yes, he's right. The bear was the empire Persia and the leopard was the next empire,"], ["13:32", " Greece. And then that great crazy beast was the Roman Empire, Rome. Verse number 17 and 18"], ["13:42", " gave us the interpretation that he said that these four beast are four kings that come up out of"], ["13:48", " the earth. But the last beast is the most interesting to Daniel for good reason. Look at verse 19,"], ["13:54", " we're still in Daniel 7, verse 19. He said, \"I wish to know the truth about the fourth beast."], ["13:59", " It's different from all the others. It's exceedingly dreadful with teeth of iron and nails,"], ["14:03", " of bronze, tap our broken to pieces, trampled residue under its feet, and the ten horns that"], ["14:09", " wrought his head and the other horn which came up before which three fell, namingly that horn"], ["14:14", " that had eyes and a mouth that spoke pompous words whose appearance was greater than his fellows."], ["14:20", " I was watching and the same horn was making war against the saints and prevailing against them"], ["14:26", " until the ancient of days came and a judgment was made in favor of the saints of the most high"], ["14:30", " and the time came for the saints to possess the kingdom.\" So this angel says, verse 23,"], ["14:38", " \"The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom on the earth which will be different from the"], ["14:43", " all other kingdoms. He shall devour the whole earth, trampled it, and break it into pieces."], ["14:48", " Ten horns are ten kings who arise from this kingdom and then another will rise from them."], ["14:54", " He's different from the first ones. He will subdue three kings. He will speak pompous words"], ["15:00", " against the most high, self-persecute the saints of the most high, and shall intend to change"], ["15:05", " the times and laws, then the saints shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.\""], ["15:15", " So this beast destroys everything on the earth, but within this beast's own being,"], ["15:21", " there's this weird action, ten horns, symbolizing ten kingdoms, rise up, and then to make it even"], ["15:30", " more confusing, ten, three of the horns are plucked out, and three kingdoms are destroyed,"], ["15:35", " but this last little horn grows up, this last king, this final king who speaks pompous words,"], ["15:41", " \"glass in God, persecutes the saints, and then we get our famous time marker a time,"], ["15:47", " times, and half a times.\" The reason why this last beast is so elaborate"], ["15:53", " and has all this activity going on, even within itself, is because it is an empire that is expanding"], ["15:59", " such a long period of time. It's encompassing two thousand years of history all the way"], ["16:06", " until the last days. Oh, how do I know that it's all the way to the last days? Because of that"], ["16:11", " statement, a time, times, and half a time, it's the same marker, the same time marker we see in"], ["16:19", " Revelation chapter 12 verse 14, where it said there that they would fly to a place and be nourished"], ["16:26", " for a time, time, and half a times, which is three and a half years. A time is one year,"], ["16:32", " times is two years, that's three and a half a time is half a year, and that's just talking about"], ["16:38", " the last three and a half years of the seven year tribulation, the end of the age."], ["16:44", " So much of what we learned in Daniel helps us understand John's vision because it's the same beast,"], ["16:51", " and it's the same beast that is referenced again in Revelation chapter 17, where I'll give you"], ["16:57", " more details in six months when we get to Revelation 17. So when we interpret John's side here in"], ["17:04", " Revelation 13, we follow the rule of using Scripture to interpret Scripture. We don't have to try to"], ["17:11", " guess, Scripture is telling us what these things mean, and the beast has explained in Daniel 17,"], ["17:17", " and in Daniel 7, and in Revelation 17. So it's not difficult to decipher the sign if you know"], ["17:23", " the other passages. Well, let me see if I can just summarize all that for you, right? Let me"], ["17:28", " package that up and make it palatable. I'm sure you recognize that the description of the dragon"], ["17:34", " matches the description of this beast. Seven heads and 10 horns, okay? The dragon likewise had seven"], ["17:41", " heads and 10 horns. What a coincidence. Well, remember that we said the seven heads are the seven"], ["17:47", " empires that Satan has used to try to destroy Israel, and Satan has been the one in control"], ["17:54", " of all of these world empires. The beast has seven heads because he likewise is a combination"], ["18:00", " and a culmination of all that Satan has been attempting to do for the last 4,000 years."], ["18:06", " And you remember that King Solomon wisely observed what has been done is what will be"], ["18:12", " and what has been done is what will has been done. And there is nothing new under the sun,"], ["18:20", " and we put it this way. History repeats itself. Ever wonder why?"], ["18:26", " Ever wonder why? Well, this shows us. Satan keeps trying and failing to accomplish"], ["18:33", " the same things that he's been trying for 6,000 years to stop the plans and purposes of God."], ["18:40", " And it's why all of these empires keep doing the same things, but nobody learns, nobody grows,"], ["18:45", " nobody moves on because the power behind the empires of this world is Satan and he's not moving"], ["18:51", " on. He's been stuck in Groundhog Day the last 4,000 years with Israel. So chapter 13 of"], ["18:58", " Revelation is the seventh empire rising up to try for the seventh final time to destroy Israel."], ["19:06", " That's what we're looking at here. The 10 horns is symbolic of an amalgamation of 10 kingdoms"], ["19:11", " who are all going to unite together to form this final world empire in Nebuchadnezzar's vision."], ["19:17", " We saw the same thing. Remember, it's like the empire with the statue and the feet with the 10"], ["19:23", " toes and it symbolized 10 kingdoms coming together in that final kingdom. So that's a reoccurring"], ["19:29", " symbol and theme and scripture. In the last days the world will be dominated by an empire that"], ["19:35", " consists of 10 kingdoms united together and they are Gentile nations when it says rising up out"], ["19:41", " of the sea. I told you I tell you what that means. As this beast is rising up out of the sea,"], ["19:48", " the nations of the world that's spoken of in Daniel and again in Revelation 17. So then it says"], ["19:55", " rising up of the sea is this beast and verse number two we're in Revelation 13 back to the passage,"], ["20:01", " we're actually trying to study. The beast which I saw was like a leopard, feet like a bear,"], ["20:07", " mouth like a lion. And those are the same animals from Daniel chapter 7, signifying that these"], ["20:13", " former kingdoms are represented and are assimilated into this one final kingdom. And that is what"], ["20:20", " we see in history. That is the facts of history. As each empire fell, the new empire assimilated"], ["20:27", " all the wealth and knowledge of the one that it conquered. As the people were brought into the new"], ["20:31", " empire, they brought in their culture, their customs, their religions. Even though they were conquered,"], ["20:36", " they influenced the new empire. So when you drive around America, you see the influences"], ["20:43", " of Great Britain. It's in the names of places, right? PG County. What's PG County? Prince George,"], ["20:51", " or you can go over across the bridge to Virginia and you what county are you in? King George,"], ["20:57", " or you can go to Calvert County and that's Lord Calvert, or Baltimore is Lord Baltimore."], ["21:03", " Where'd all this come from? America doesn't have lords or kings or princes, but England does"], ["21:10", " and we got their names and we got their language and we got their laws. And even though America"], ["21:17", " was victorious over England, the influences of England are still everywhere in our country."], ["21:25", " Same, sure, with these empires, they all have their vestiges of the previous empires incorporated"], ["21:32", " into this one final empire. That's what it means by the lion and the bear and the leopard."], ["21:37", " But where does this power come from? Verse 2, where does the power come from?"], ["21:42", " The dragon gave him power, his throne, in great authority. Well, the dragon's the devil. We learned"], ["21:51", " that last week. So let me reiterate the reason why the description of the dragon and the beast"], ["21:56", " match is because the dragon is the power behind all these empires. And he still is today."], ["22:02", " And that is upsetting to people when I point out the fact that America is a nation under"], ["22:11", " Satan's influence. Not as total control, but he certainly has great influence. And my evidence"], ["22:19", " of this is the fruits. Paul tells us, if you want to know what spirit is controlling someone,"], ["22:26", " look at their fruit. Galatians chapter 5, it says in Galatians 5, the works of the flesh are"], ["22:33", " evidence. And they are adultries, fornications and cleanliness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery,"], ["22:40", " hatred, contentions, jealousy, oh, birth of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies,"], ["22:47", " envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like of which I told you before, just as"], ["22:52", " also I told you in times past, that those who practice these things do not inherit the kingdom"], ["22:57", " of God. But the fruit of the spirit is what? Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,"], ["23:08", " faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Now for sure, I interact with people in community"], ["23:18", " who evidence the fruit of the spirit. I know so many people who are kind and good and faithful,"], ["23:26", " and yes, there are many Christians in America, and we see Christian values at work as people look"], ["23:31", " for ways to help. For example, the hurricane victims of North Carolina. And when Keith and Judy are"], ["23:36", " heading down there with those supplies that you all donated, they probably don't have enough room"], ["23:41", " in their truck. So, you know, that's Americans love to rally and together and help one another in"], ["23:48", " a time in need. That is Christian values. But what does the government offer? Apparently, little"], ["23:55", " note didn't help because they wasted all of the FEMA budget. They squandered it on,"], ["24:00", " and stole it by, it was stolen by politicians and squandered. So, what is promoted by the leadership of"], ["24:06", " the country? What is endorsed by the governing institutions? What happens in the places of power"], ["24:11", " and influence? What is showcased in the media and broadcast to the world? Is it not?"], ["24:16", " idolatry fornications and cleanliness, lewdness, sorceries, hatred, contention, jealousy,"], ["24:23", " oh, burst of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries."], ["24:30", " I don't point these things out to offend you. I point these things out so that we, children of"], ["24:37", " God, followers of Jesus, will be diligent to not love the world. Satan's empire, but rather that"], ["24:44", " we would be sanctified and set apart from it. Because our job in these last days is to be salt and"], ["24:49", " light. Salt that stems the decay and light that repels the darkness, and we have to call it out."], ["24:56", " We do not want to be guilty of calling evil good and good evil. Well, I saw just this week that"], ["25:04", " Melania Trump released a book, her memoirs, and one of the things that was in the news that she wrote"], ["25:10", " in the book is how she used pro-choice and how she said that a woman's fundamental right to"], ["25:15", " individual liberty to her own life grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy as she wishes."], ["25:21", " And she said, \"I've carried that belief with me throughout my entire life.\""], ["25:24", " So we have to understand what is going on. Satan is a deceiver and a murderer,"], ["25:31", " and when we see his handiwork, we know he's in control. And I don't want you to be fooled."], ["25:36", " Paul said, \"A great deception, strong delusions, come in the last days. The coming of the"], ["25:43", " lawless one is according to the deeds of Satan with all powers and the signs of line wonders."], ["25:48", " And with all unrighteousness, deception comes upon those who perish, because they don't receive"], ["25:54", " the love of the truth that they might be saved. For this is the reason that God is sending a strong"], ["25:58", " delusion that they will believe a lie. They may be condemned who do not believe the truth,"], ["26:04", " but they have pleasure in unrighteousness.\" And Jesus warned us that Matthew, false,"], ["26:08", " Christ, and false prophets will rise performing great signs and wonders so as to lead astray,"], ["26:14", " even the elect. And we are warned to not be deceived and not be led astray. And in these"], ["26:22", " last days, this is all you can trust. You know the media lies? I don't have to convince anybody"], ["26:30", " of that. So where is the truth? So verse number three, Revelation 13, verse 3, \"I saw one of the heads,"], ["26:39", " it was mortally wounded and his deadly wound was healed and all the world marveled and followed the"], ["26:46", " beast.\" That's a very specific detail. Now this is where we see that the symbolism has layers."], ["26:55", " There's a double meaning here. The beast, we already said, is an empire, an amalgamation of all"], ["27:00", " previous world empires controlled by Satan, but the beast is also spoken of as a person who leads"], ["27:07", " the empire. It's one and the same, right? So if I showed you a picture of Vladimir Putin,"], ["27:14", " you would relate him to Russia. If I showed you a picture of Benjamin Netanyahu,"], ["27:19", " you would correlate him with Israel. The human leader is synonymous with the nation that he is"], ["27:25", " leading. So when it says one of the heads was fatally wounded, but healed, there's possibly a double"], ["27:30", " meaning, a double interpretation, a wounded empire and a wounded emperor. A kingdom that has died,"], ["27:37", " but was healed and a leader that will be fatally wounded in the head, but he will be healed."], ["27:42", " So this is so very interesting. Follow me as I impact this. First, let's talk about the wounded kingdom."], ["27:52", " All these empires that Satan controlled, they all fell to each other,"], ["27:57", " Babylon to Persia, Persia to Greece, Greece to Rome, but it didn't matter to Satan because they were"], ["28:03", " all pagan and they all served the same purpose to give him a spirit being some legal authority"], ["28:09", " over people in property in the physical world. Even when Babylon fell to Persia, Greece to Rome,"], ["28:14", " it did not hurt Satan's overall rule of these empires, the property and the people."], ["28:21", " But one empire was wounded in such a way it severely impacted Satan's authority in the realm,"], ["28:27", " the physical realm of men, which one wasn't, and how was it fatally wounded?"], ["28:32", " There was this great empire that Satan controlled and when it collapsed, there was not another"], ["28:39", " pagan power to replace it because the people of the empire had stopped believing in those gods"], ["28:46", " of the empire and they put in their faith in Jesus. With the spread of the gospel in the Roman"], ["28:51", " empire and then to the whole world when the people turned to Jesus and rejected the gods of"], ["28:56", " antiquities, Satan's legacy of global empires control was fatally wounded. Remember up until then,"], ["29:05", " the only nation of the world that believed in the one true God was Israel. Although the rest"], ["29:12", " worshiped false gods and all religions were leading back to Satan, but with the rise of Christianity"], ["29:18", " for the first time since the Tower of Babel, since Genesis, the Gentile nations worshiped the one"], ["29:25", " true God through faith in Jesus Christ and it is profound to go visit Europe. Anybody been to Europe"], ["29:33", " recently? You to walk around the European countries and see ancient ruins of Rome and Greece,"], ["29:42", " but that's what they are. They're ruins broken down. All of the great temples to Zeus in Apollo"], ["29:50", " thrown down. Meanwhile, what stands majestically in every town is cathedrals and Christian churches"], ["29:59", " places built to worship Jesus by the people in the cultures who embraced him. The gospel of Jesus"], ["30:05", " Christ was the deadly wound to the Roman empire. Judeo-Christian doctrines and values"], ["30:11", " replaced the heat and cultures, the paganisms that had dominated those people in those lands,"], ["30:15", " enlightenment, revolutionized the European civilization and expanded to the Americas. It was such"], ["30:22", " a devastating loss for Satan that he actually had to join the church. In order to rebuild his"], ["30:28", " empire, he had to infiltrate the church and work within the people who were singing hymns"], ["30:33", " and prayer and prayers to Jesus. And once he got made some headway and he almost had fully gained"], ["30:39", " influence over the Catholic church and corrupted it, the whole thing split to a whole bunch of"], ["30:44", " churches, decentralizing power preventing him from having complete control. And this was all of Europe."], ["30:53", " When the holy Roman empire finally broke apart, there was no longer any mechanism human agency"], ["30:59", " that he could use to control the whole world. And the Roman empire was given a deadly wound."], ["31:03", " And yet, it's going to be healed. And it will rise again when 10 kings join together,"], ["31:10", " the broken empire is going to be healed. So that is true of the empire and the double meaning,"], ["31:19", " it will also be true of the leader of this empire. He too will suffer a deadly wound,"], ["31:24", " but it will be healed. Look at these passages, chapter 13, verse number four."], ["31:30", " So they worship the dragon who worshiped the beast and they worshiped the beast. Who's like the beast?"], ["31:36", " Who could make more for him? So that this is an empire, but now look, the pronoun goes very personal."], ["31:42", " He was given a mouth, speaking great things, blasphemies. And he was given authority to control"], ["31:48", " for 42 months. He opened his mouth to blaspheme against God to blaspheme his name, his tabernacle,"], ["31:53", " and those who dwell in heaven. He was granted to him to make war with the saints and overcome them."], ["31:57", " The authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation, and all who dwell in the earth"], ["32:03", " will worship him. Verse number 11, I saw another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two"], ["32:09", " horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon. He exercised all the authority of the first beast in"], ["32:13", " his presence, causing the earth and those who dwell on it to worship the first beast whose deadly"], ["32:18", " wound was healed. He performed great signs, even to make fire come down from heaven on the"], ["32:22", " earth and the sight of men. And he deceives those who dwell in the earth by the signs which"], ["32:26", " should granted him to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell in the earth to make"], ["32:30", " an image of the beast who is wounded by the sword and lived. So we observe that the beast,"], ["32:37", " this empire, is personified and represented in a world leader. And scripture gives us many names"], ["32:43", " for this guy. We call him the beast and we call him who adults. The prince who is to come,"], ["32:50", " the little horn, the lawless one, the son of perdition, and the most popular name that we call him,"], ["32:55", " the Antichrist. And scripture affirms in many passages that there is this particular leader"], ["33:02", " of this final empire who comes and does these shocking things, the son of perdition,"], ["33:07", " who opposes and exalts himself above it all called God, or that is worship, that he sits as God"], ["33:12", " in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. The individual is doing this. But this deadly"], ["33:20", " wound that is heals, the whole world is amazed by this miracle, almost like he was resurrected."], ["33:30", " This is possibly the great deception that a world leader is so badly wounded. Everyone thinks he's"], ["33:36", " dead, but he rises back to life. Well, that's exactly what our faith is built on, the resurrection"], ["33:45", " of Jesus Christ. So Satan will have a fake resurrection of the Antichrist to inspire the world's"], ["33:53", " faith in that man. You remember when, you know, back in July, when Trump was shot in the"], ["33:58", " year, he was bleeding, but then he got up and he was fighting, right? And that inspires people to"], ["34:02", " want to vote for him, because people relate to the idea of being knocked down and rising up,"], ["34:07", " you know, just too stubborn and too determined and too tough to quit. You all think, yeah, that's me,"], ["34:11", " right? Life knocks me down, but I get myself back up. I won't quit. In this deadly wound that the"], ["34:17", " Antichrist recovers from will amaze the world. Verse number four tells us, Revelation 13, verse 4,"], ["34:25", " they worship the dragon who worship the beast and they worship the beast. Say, who's like the beast,"], ["34:30", " who's able to make war with him? So Satan infuses the Antichrist with all of his power."], ["34:35", " Remember, we learned last week when the dragons cast out, he knows his time is short,"], ["34:40", " and this is one final push to destroy the people of God, one last chance to stop God's word"], ["34:46", " from coming true. And he's given the Antichrist has given this mouth, speaking great things,"], ["34:53", " and blasphemies, he's given authority to continue for 42 months, and opens his mouth and he"], ["35:00", " blasphemes God, and he blasphemes his name and his tabernacle and all that dwell in heaven."], ["35:05", " blaspheme, that's a Greek word that we adopted into our English language. The Greek word is"], ["35:10", " blasphema. It's all it's the same. It means to speak evil of. And that's very interesting, right?"], ["35:17", " Because he's not rejecting God. He's not denying the powers of heaven. He's speaking evil of it."], ["35:24", " So remember, this is seven years of tribulation. And during the great tribulation,"], ["35:29", " there has been so much catastrophe poured out on the earth that's been the judgments of God."], ["35:35", " And remember in chapter 11, these two witnesses, these prophets are on the world for the"], ["35:39", " first three and a half years, explaining to everybody what's happening and why?"], ["35:44", " Tell everybody what everything that's going on is God's judgments. And he's angry at us,"], ["35:49", " and you need to repent of your sins, and you need to trust in Jesus. And that's how you can be"], ["35:53", " spared. And people tried to stop them, and people tried to kill them, but they had power to defend"], ["35:59", " themselves until they were permitted to be killed. And then they laid in the streets for three and a"], ["36:04", " half days, but then it says the whole world after three and a half days saw them resurrected, and a voice"], ["36:13", " saying, \"I'll send up to heaven.\" And everybody saw that. So everybody understands the whole world"], ["36:20", " at this time. Nobody's rejecting that they don't believe there is a God. They do believe there's a"], ["36:25", " God in heaven. But this guy is defiant and arrogant and accusing God of evil. And he has rallying the"], ["36:35", " world to stand with him, believing that they could save the world from this evil God in heaven"], ["36:41", " who's doing all these horrible things to us, that we have, if we use our power and we use our"], ["36:46", " technology and we work together, we can save the world from this evil God, from the heaven who's"], ["36:50", " coming to judge and destroy us, which should be a very familiar storyline to us after all,"], ["36:57", " that is the plot of the Marvel movies that we have been watching for the past 10 to 15 years."], ["37:02", " And over 100 million people watch the Avengers movies where the transhumanists, the scientists,"], ["37:08", " the tech, the dummy gods all joined together to save the earth and there the heroes and the alien"], ["37:14", " god threatened the earth as the bad guy and even gave him a name and Greek that means God, Thanos,"], ["37:21", " that's what it means. So even though I did enjoy the action adventure superhero movies, I do watch"], ["37:27", " them and I own them. But it's kind of hard for me because I know the Bible and the message is so"], ["37:32", " blatantly obvious to me. Avengers is revelation in backwards. It's flipped around. So there's your"], ["37:39", " source material for all those movies. It's the great deception of the Antichrist. God is evil"], ["37:46", " and we can defeat him. But it doesn't just stop with trying to defeat God. Ideas have consequences"], ["37:55", " and since the Antichrist teaches God is evil, then it stands to reason that all who believe in him,"], ["38:00", " they are, they're evil. And this is the rationale that they use to justify killing all who believe"], ["38:07", " in Jesus, verse number seven. And it was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome"], ["38:14", " them and the authority was given to him over every tribe, tongue, and nation.

The River Euphrates Is Drying (Pastor Rob McNutt)", "id": "UggUnPba2l0", "date": "2025-01-10", "transcript": [["00:00", " I'd like you to take your copy of the Word of God and turn to Revelation chapter 16 as we"], ["00:26", " continue on back into our study of the book of Revelation, we are in verse number 12, Revelation 16, verse 12, John"], ["00:35", " writes, \"Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the river Euphrates, and the water was dried"], ["00:42", " up so that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared.\" And I saw three unclean spirits"], ["00:51", " like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the"], ["00:55", " mouth of the false prophet, for they are spirits of demons performing signs which go out to the"], ["01:01", " kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty."], ["01:09", " The whole I am coming as a thief, blessed to see who watches and keeps his garments lest he walk"], ["01:16", " naked and see his shame. And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew"], ["01:24", " Armageddon. That's five verses loaded with information, the sixth bowl judgment. The"], ["01:32", " bowl judgments are the final seven judgments God is pouring out on the world in the seven year"], ["01:38", " tribulation. First bowl judgment was horrible sores, broke out on everyone who took the"], ["01:45", " mark of the beast. The second bowl was the oceans were turned to dead man's blood and all the"], ["01:53", " seed life dies. The third bowl is all the fresh water, the spring waters turned to blood as well."], ["02:00", " The fourth bowl, the sun was poured out on the sun and it became intensely hot and scorches."], ["02:07", " The earth and the people. Fifth one was the any Christ kingdom was plunged into darkness."], ["02:14", " Darkness is a curse. People can't do anything when it is dark. Normally we don't worry about"], ["02:20", " darkness because we have lights. Electricity in all of our cities and buildings are well lit and"], ["02:26", " we drive at night no problem. The only time we have to be in the dark is when we choose to be"], ["02:33", " in the dark and we just turn the lights out and go to bed. So for there to be darkness that means"], ["02:42", " the power grid has to have gone down, right? So there's no electricity and nothing's working."], ["02:46", " I thought of maybe like an EMP attack would do something like that, right? Knock out all the"], ["02:52", " electricity and all the technology. But this bowl judgment of darkness is communicating it's just"], ["02:58", " not at night. It's also darkness in the day. Now that would be terribly unsettling. We depend on"], ["03:04", " sunrise to mark our days. The sun is the center of our universe and it's one of the most powerful"], ["03:10", " forces that we can relate to. The sun dwarfs everything. It outshines all other celestial bodies."], ["03:15", " So it would be incredibly concerning to realize something's wrong with the sun."], ["03:19", " That's a very effective way for God to showcase his power to communicate to the people in the"], ["03:26", " any Christ kingdom that he is God and their leader is not by taking away the light of the sun."], ["03:35", " So those are the bold judgments that we covered last week. Now onto the six bowl, which has a very"], ["03:42", " unique reason behind it. The River Euphrates is dried up. That's the bold judgment for the express"], ["03:49", " purpose of the nations to come to the final battle. All right, let's get into that. First of"], ["03:56", " all the drying up of the River Euphrates, that in and of itself would be astounding to John's first"], ["04:02", " century audience because the River Euphrates has been around since the dawn of creation."], ["04:07", " First mentioned in Genesis chapter two, when civilization was born that river was there,"], ["04:12", " when Noah's sons came off the ark, they followed the River Euphrates down at a turkey to the"], ["04:17", " plains of Shynar and built the first post flood kingdoms. The great empire of Babylon was built on"], ["04:24", " the banks of the River Euphrates. It acted as a natural border between East and West. It's the most"], ["04:30", " essential river in the ancient world. The River Euphrates is dried up in possible, you think."], ["04:37", " Let me show you a video. The rap is oil rich for their country is plagued by poverty. After decades"], ["04:43", " of war, drought and desertification adding more to the disaster. The fact is that the river you"], ["04:48", " say water the biblical garden of Eden is found to be slowly drying up. Drought in the Euphrates River"], ["04:54", " has been a phenomenon with a lot of religious backing. However, when the Bible says particular"], ["05:01", " things will happen, it doesn't tell if it's due to nature or because of man's politics or industry."], ["05:06", " They happened. One of Western Asia is most essential and longest rivers is the Euphrates."], ["05:12", " It originates in Turkey and travels through the southeast mountains and southern foothills of the"], ["05:17", " area before flowing into Syria and Iraq and a variety of vegetation before emptying into the"], ["05:23", " Persian Gulf. A satellite photo has shocked everyone. Even scientists were surprised to see this river"], ["05:30", " drying up so quickly. While this image is from 2021 when the Euphrates River was full,"], ["05:36", " but now look at this picture, it is reported by Google Earth in 2023. The Euphrates River is"], ["05:43", " almost completely drying up. This is the Anatower in Iraq. You can see the Anatower has"], ["05:50", " show off completely. It is the measures of the waters in the region, but now it is left without"], ["05:56", " water around it. From this picture, you can tell that the Euphrates River is dying now. Soon,"], ["06:01", " it will be the river without water. Actually, it is not river. It is called Haditha Dam."], ["06:07", " It's the largest dam on Euphrates rivers in Iraq. And you see that this tower has completely"], ["06:14", " show up and the waters is very little left. There are many peoples are pumping water from the river"], ["06:20", " for their supply. They pump the water to their homes and their agriculture use. We can see the"], ["06:26", " water quality from this river is very bad and this is very unsafe to drink. They will suffer from"], ["06:31", " diarrhea and various kinds of diseases if they consume the water. Many reason have completely"], ["06:37", " drying up. In this area was once a fertile area. And farms can grow various kinds of crops here."], ["06:44", " Now, it has become a barren desert that is impossible to grow and attain."], ["06:48", " So, it's not officially completely dried up, but as well on its way. John says it's drying up for"], ["06:59", " a particular reason, verse 13, though that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared."], ["07:05", " Who are the kings of the east? In Scripture, the east, of course, refers to a geographical"], ["07:11", " country east of Israel. Here's a little map for you. And the red line is the river Euphrates."], ["07:19", " I know I should have drew it blue, but I wanted to really pop. By the way, did you notice that the"], ["07:24", " screens are bigger? Nobody noticed. We put up some bigger screens. There's 15 more inches up there,"], ["07:30", " for you to see. And I just thought I'd throw slides and videos at you so I could test around them."], ["07:35", " All right, back to the map. Okay, so the river Euphrates is there in the red. And I noticed"], ["07:40", " the just some of the countries to the east. I'm Martin Yellow. A Rand being the one that we hear"], ["07:46", " the most about because it's always hostile to Israel. When the biblical authors say east,"], ["07:53", " they're always talking about typically Babylon, Persia, of course, Iran's Persia. And then further"], ["07:59", " into the Asian continent. But I thought I'd give you a bigger view of other kings that might be"], ["08:04", " east of this river over here. These countries are all east of the river Euphrates. And I"], ["08:12", " underlined some of them for you. Now, technically Russia, we'd be considered the nation to the north."], ["08:17", " But many of these eastern countries are Muslim nations, not known for their peaceful"], ["08:23", " attitudes towards Israel. Also, we have China and India, huge populations in those countries"], ["08:30", " with aspirations of global dominance. And then of course, we got the little"], ["08:35", " Hermit nation of North Korea. I circled them all the way over there,"], ["08:39", " simply because they have nuclear capabilities. And they don't play well with others."], ["08:43", " All of these nations are ones that really do not ally themselves with us western countries."], ["08:49", " However, this is not west versus east during the tribulation. No, all of these countries,"], ["08:55", " all of them are being drawn to Israel to join the Antichrist for this one great battle."], ["09:02", " They gathered together verse 16 says to the place in Hebrew called Armageddon. The word"], ["09:08", " Armageddon is used generically today to refer to any type of catastrophic conflict that might"], ["09:15", " result in destruction or a lot of people dying. Or we use the words like Armageddon"], ["09:21", " and apocalypse to talk about things that we might think are, you know, going to be somewhat"], ["09:28", " disturbing, like snow may get it. You know, three to five inches of snow. It's snow may get"], ["09:36", " all right, guys, it's not going to be that bad. Three to five inches of snow is every Tuesday in Canada"], ["09:45", " from October to May. Not a big deal. We'll survive it. But we use those words a lot when we want"], ["09:53", " to kind of like really talk like, whoo, this is going to be really rough. In Revelation, Armageddon"], ["10:00", " is not just, oh, it might be somewhat of a challenge. No, it is the climactic battle between"], ["10:09", " Jesus and all the rest of the nations in the world that are following the Antichrist. That is"], ["10:15", " the only appropriate use of the word Armageddon. The word ultimately comes from the Hebrew word"], ["10:21", " harmagito, which means Mount Megito or the predicted location of the battle. The exact location"], ["10:28", " of Armageddon is unclear since there is no mount called Megito. However, since horror in the Hebrew"], ["10:34", " means hill, the most likely location is the hill country surrounding the plains of Megito."], ["10:39", " And I showed you another yet another slide with arrows pointing to exactly where that valley is."], ["10:47", " It's also called the valley of Jezreel. It's a valley in the northern part of the country of"], ["10:53", " Israel, 20 miles long and about seven miles wide. Napoleon Bonaparte, you know that name from"], ["11:00", " history. He stood in the valley of Megito and remarked that all the armies of the world could"], ["11:03", " maneuver their forces in this vast plane. Now, that was for his time. I don't think that would"], ["11:09", " apply to all the armies of the world now. But during the past 4000 years, at least 34 bloody"], ["11:15", " conflicts have already been fought in that ancient site of Megito and in the Jezreel valley."], ["11:22", " The Egyptian is the Canaanites. The Israelites, the Midianites, the Amalekites, the Philistines,"], ["11:26", " Hasmanians, Greeks, Romans, Muslims, Crusaders, Mongoloids, French, Ottoman, British, Australians,"], ["11:33", " Germans, Arabs. And modern day Israelis have all fought and died in that spot. Megito was the site of the"], ["11:42", " battle with the Arabs in the Israeli war in 1948. Why? Why is there so many battles being fought in"], ["11:50", " that one place? Because whoever controls Megito had control of one of the major trade routes"], ["11:59", " of antiquities known as the way of the sea. This ancient highway winds its way directly"], ["12:06", " through Israel, right past Megito in the valley of Jezreel, this Jezreel, this strategic"], ["12:13", " place road ran between Egypt to the south and Mesopotamia to the east following up and"], ["12:21", " around down through the river Euphrates. And then also going up north to modern day Turkey and"], ["12:28", " going on into Europe. So it's the crossroads of the ancient world. And virtually every invading"], ["12:36", " army that came into this region during the past 4000 years fought to control Megito"], ["12:42", " in the Jezreel valley. There's also a river in that valley. It's called the Kishan River. And"], ["12:48", " some of you Sunday school teachers might remember the name of that because several"], ["12:52", " scriptural battles, biblical battles were fought there that were very important to our"], ["12:58", " Old Testament. We had the battle of the Judge Barak in Deborah fought and beat the Canaanites in"], ["13:06", " that very valley. And then Gideon won the victory over the Midianites in that valley."], ["13:11", " Also, if you see in the red, I highlighted to the left the Mount Carmel. And what happened to"], ["13:20", " Mount Carmel, you remember from 1 Kings chapter 18, was the showdown between Elijah and the"], ["13:27", " prophets of Baal. And of course, you remember after God won that showdown and lit the altar on fire"], ["13:35", " and proved everybody who the true God was, all the prophets of Baal got marched down to the"], ["13:39", " river, Kishan. You know, you Sunday school teachers remember what happened there, right? They all got"], ["13:43", " slaughtered at the river. So it's very interesting. I also learned that the river Kishan in Arabic"], ["13:54", " is translated river of slaughter or dismemberment. So I thought that was very telling since that's"], ["14:02", " what's happened there in the past so many times. And it's what will happen in the future at the"], ["14:07", " Battle of Armageddon. Now, there's another underlying in red. I don't know if you can read it. It's"], ["14:14", " a little town that you might recognize the name of Nazareth. That's also right on the boundaries"], ["14:22", " there. Nazareth and what's that place famous for. So Jesus is from, right? So I thought that was"], ["14:29", " very interesting how all the nations of the world come to face off against Jesus in the very region"], ["14:36", " that he would have grown up as a child. So chapter 16 is telling us how all the nations are preparing"], ["14:42", " for battle and that battle is going to take place in actually chapter 19. So I wanted you to"], ["14:49", " understand that right now from chapter 16, 17, 18 and 19, this is all like condensed happening"], ["14:57", " altogether. But the problem with Pastor Rob is he preaches through all these chapters is going to"], ["15:02", " take Pastor Rob the rest of the year. I don't know how long it's going to take me to"], ["15:08", " preach through those chapters. But we have to try to remember that this is all happening all"], ["15:13", " at once, all in real time. This is all really rapid fire. So bear with me as I can't really"], ["15:19", " preach at all in one shot. But I'm sure you couldn't help notice the detail John gives explaining"], ["15:26", " what is influencing the kings of the east to come join the Antichrist to fight this battle. What"], ["15:32", " was that? Verse number 13, I saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the"], ["15:39", " dragon, the mouth of the beast and the mouth of the frog's prophet for they are spirits of demons"], ["15:45", " performing signs which go out to the kings of the earth and the whole world gathering them for"], ["15:50", " the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Demon frogs, what? What is John talking about?"], ["15:59", " So if you, it's your first Sunday at Faith Bible Church, this might sound really weird,"], ["16:06", " like nothing you hear normally in a church on Sunday morning. For people who have been attending"], ["16:13", " here for the last 10 months, you're like, ooh, ooh, I think I know what this is all about. And for"], ["16:19", " anyone who's been around here, for any length of time, say over a year, you're like, demon frogs,"], ["16:24", " this sounds like any normal sermon at Faith Bible Church. Okay, so something to remind everyone,"], ["16:32", " God is a supernatural being. And the Bible, whose author is the Holy Spirit, is the one book that"], ["16:43", " gives humanity accurate information about the supernatural. Therefore, we take the Bible"], ["16:51", " literally. If you've been with us for a couple of months, you'll remember these characters,"], ["16:57", " the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet. You know who they are. If you don't know or you don't"], ["17:03", " remember, then go back to our YouTube channel and watch September 29th, October 6th, and October 13th."], ["17:11", " Watch all those three sermons, and they will explain in detail the dragon, the beast, and the"], ["17:16", " false prophet. I can't get into all the details. I'll give you the summary. The dragon in Scripture"], ["17:22", " has many names, the devil, Satan, Lucifer, the serpent. He's one of the greatest angels that God ever"], ["17:30", " created, but he rebelled against God, and he led one-third of all the angels in heaven with him."], ["17:36", " There was a war in heaven and the devil lost and one-third of the angels, and he"], ["17:40", " were cast to the earth. He knows he can't overpower God, but he's still trying to oppose God."], ["17:46", " How's he doing this? Well, the Bible teaches us a great deal about Satan. He's called our adversary."], ["17:53", " When we study him, we realize what his strategy is. He's trying to get something God declared"], ["18:00", " in his word to not come to pass. God has declared that his word is truth, and all that he has"], ["18:07", " spoken will be fulfilled. God has spoken many things to mankind. He has made promises. He has made"], ["18:14", " covenants to people. This is where the devil's taking the fight. If he can get the promises that"], ["18:21", " God has made to people to not come true, then he can prove that God is a liar, which means God"], ["18:27", " has sin, which means he's not holy or perfect, which means the decrees that God made about"], ["18:33", " Satan could possibly not come true. That's the big cosmic chess match that's being played"], ["18:40", " out all throughout human history. Most people are oblivious to any of this. They do not have"], ["18:48", " spiritual understanding. They think all that is is the physical world and their skeptical"], ["18:54", " about other dimensions that they cannot see, taste, touch, smell, or feel. They don't think about"], ["19:03", " them. Some people do have understanding. Lots of people have understanding of the spiritual dimension,"], ["19:10", " but there's a great deal of confusion on the topic, and that's because the devil's a liar,"], ["19:15", " and the evil spirits are deceptive, and they have an agenda that they're working nonstop to accomplish."], ["19:20", " So even the people who are aware and interested in the spirit world, many of them are misled and"], ["19:26", " even being used by Satan for his goals, which is to somehow prevent God's word from coming true."], ["19:31", " And then, last but not least, there are those of us who have a pretty good understanding of what"], ["19:36", " is going on in the spirit world and how it impacts the physical world. How do we know? Because God"], ["19:42", " told us what is going on, and his word is true, and it keeps being proven true all throughout"], ["19:49", " history. I showed you an example of something we're seeing taking place even before our very eyes."], ["19:56", " 2,000 years ago, John writes that wherever your freedom is going to dry up, and that sounded"], ["20:00", " impossible to John into the people 2,000 years ago, and yet today, the river Euphrates is"], ["20:07", " drying up.

this morning, I thought we ought to have a little exercise"], ["00:26", " in transparency. I'm not a great intellect. I'm not super skilled. There's all kinds"], ["00:36", " of things that other people know better than me, subjects you know way more than I do"], ["00:42", " on. Many people are doing a great deal of ministry and service to the people of this church"], ["00:47", " and community, teaching the children, the teens, running the programs, helping people in"], ["00:53", " a time indeed serving, giving large sums of money. In order for this church to accomplish"], ["00:59", " all that we're attempting to do, it requires a high level of commitment and sacrifice"], ["01:03", " on behalf of the membership to make it all happen. However, for whatever reason, I've"], ["01:09", " been given the position of pastors. I'm the guy who leads the church and I collaborate"], ["01:13", " with the other leaders, but they seem to take my recommendations seriously. Even though"], ["01:19", " I am neither of great intellect or skill. I see the challenge. This presents. I know"], ["01:28", " my weaknesses and I'm not the best person for the position and yet for some reason, God"], ["01:34", " saw fit to put us together and is blessing our efforts and God continues to work in and"], ["01:41", " through us despite my shortcomings. That's not a secret. Pretty much anyone who's been"], ["01:47", " working and serving in this church, running like the time, they would just say, yeah, yeah,"], ["01:51", " we know that pastor up. But I think it's from time to time, it's appropriate to be"], ["01:56", " transparent about that for the sake of new people that are joining. People come to the"], ["02:01", " meet and greet luncheon and also for like the 20-year-olds who've grown up here, they're"], ["02:06", " coming in to adulthood. They need to realize that we all know that because sooner or later"], ["02:12", " they're going to figure it out. I don't want anyone to think that we're pulling some bait"], ["02:16", " and switch when they recognize my obvious deficiencies. Has anyone else noticed Pastor Rob's"], ["02:24", " not really super smart? He's really not phenomenally talented. He seems to lack a little"], ["02:35", " piety. Yeah. Nobody has said Pastor Rob was good at any of that stuff. Just go read"], ["02:43", " the bio on the website. Everyone here is working in and around my deficiencies. This yet"], ["02:53", " again is another one of those pieces of evidence that God's word is coming true before"], ["02:58", " our very eyes. Because Paul said in 1 Corinthians, God has chosen the foolish things of"], ["03:03", " this world to shame the wise. The God has chosen the weak things of this world to shame"], ["03:10", " the mighty. See, that's me. And that's one of the ingredients that makes up the recipe"], ["03:14", " of success of Faith Bible Church. If anything's working in this place, God gets the glory."], ["03:21", " As he should, his church, following his word, doing the things that he said he would bless."], ["03:28", " We're not inventing anything new here. We're just following the manual. And then the"], ["03:32", " Holy Spirit speaks to people, calls them, challenges us, helps us overlook. Each others"], ["03:39", " fault some failures keeps us striving to love one another and to serve one another. And"], ["03:46", " we do all this in collaboration with one another to accomplish a common goal that everyone"], ["03:53", " would hear the good news that Jesus Christ and hopefully trust in him. We're trying to"], ["03:58", " help everyone pursue God's plans and purposes for their lives. We believe Jesus one day"], ["04:04", " is going to come back. And all of his followers are good on Herod, his kingdom, and he"], ["04:09", " will rule overall and you can be part of that kingdom. So that's some transparency about"], ["04:15", " everything that we're trying to do here. Hopefully that's helpful as God's servants. We want"], ["04:20", " to be transparent. The other side is not so forthcoming. The Word of God makes it very"], ["04:28", " plain that we are struggling with three challenging forces. Our own sin nature, which is"], ["04:35", " called the flesh, spiritual forces, which we call the devil and demons, and then something"], ["04:45", " called the world. The devil wants us to reject the true God who created us and worship"], ["04:53", " him instead. But he can't just openly tell you that. He can't just be transparent because"], ["04:58", " of people knew the facts nobody would follow him. I'm the devil. I'm a least lesser powerful"], ["05:06", " being, but I'm rebelling against the all powerful creator God. He's going to punish me for"], ["05:10", " all the eternity for my rebellion. Follow me instead of him. That's not going to sell."], ["05:18", " So he has to lie and deceive people to follow him. Matter of fact, he has to get people"], ["05:22", " to follow him without even knowing that they're following him. How is that possible?"], ["05:27", " By getting people to join something that he's controlling without them understanding"], ["05:33", " that he's the one behind it? What is this thing that he gets everyone to join and buy"], ["05:40", " into that he's in control of? The world's, the corrupt human governments institutions"], ["05:49", " also known as Babylon. It's a very big topic. The world is this massive, bloated, evil"], ["05:57", " system that controls everything and the devil runs it from the shadows, but humanity"], ["06:04", " built it for him and we let him control us through it. There's your intro turning your"], ["06:11", " copy of the Word of God to Revelation chapter 17. Revelation chapter 17. Let's read about"], ["06:20", " this imagery and then let's explain it. Verse number one, then one of the seven angels"], ["06:27", " who had the seven bowls came and talked with me saying to me, \"Come, I will show you"], ["06:32", " the judgment of the great harlot who sits on the many wars with whom the kings of the"], ["06:38", " earth commit fornication and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine"], ["06:42", " of her fornication.\" So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and I saw a woman"], ["06:47", " sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of names and blasphemies having seven heads and 10 horns."], ["06:53", " The woman was a raid in purple and scarlet adorned with gold, precious stones, pearls,"], ["06:58", " having in her hand, a golden cup full of the abominations and the filtiness of her fornication."], ["07:05", " And on her forehead, a name was written, \"Mystery, Babylon the Great, the mother of harlot and the"], ["07:11", " abominations of the earth. I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood"], ["07:16", " of the martyrs of Jesus.

You know,"], ["07:26", " wild animals that are big and powerful. We generally don't get anywhere near them because it's too"], ["07:31", " dangerous. Did you know that polar bears grow to 10 feet tall? How would you like to be near"], ["07:36", " like a polar bear rears up that? That's crazy. Or maybe something that is very rich and extravagant."], ["07:44", " You know, you just stop and say, \"Ooh, that's just breath-taking.\" Some people are so beautiful,"], ["07:51", " they're stunning and you can't help look at them. I know I have that problem."], ["07:59", " And what about something dark and sinister? If something or someone is ominous looking,"], ["08:06", " you can't help but pay attention to them because when something's threatening, our senses"], ["08:10", " intuitively lock in on it and like, you know, that could be dangerous. We need to pay close attention"], ["08:16", " to that. John sees all of these tied together in one picture. John marvels with great amazement,"], ["08:24", " it says here, \"At this woman riding the beast, amazement is the Greek word, thambo, thao,"], ["08:31", " madzo.\" It means shocked, amazed.

And the city's name is? Babylon."], ["09:18", " As we learned last week, the imagery of the woman in the scripture implies a religious system,"], ["09:24", " as the church is called the bride of Christ, false religions in the Old Testament are connected to"], ["09:30", " adultery and fortication, so a harlot communicates this city has a false religion, a false belief."], ["09:36", " Also, it's very wealthy as it's described with the gold and the pearls and the precious stones,"], ["09:42", " and it's also guilty of killing the people of God. So this false religion has power over the"], ["09:48", " kings of the earth. It did in the past, it doesn't the president will in the future. What religion"], ["09:53", " has power over all the earth? Past president of future. Catholicism? Islam? Secular humanism?"], ["10:04", " I'll give you hint. Jesus said in Matthew chapter 6, \"No one can serve two masters. You'll either"], ["10:13", " hate one and love the other, or it'll be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both"], ["10:17", " God and mammon.\" That's a transliteration of a Greek word mammonos. It means wealth, riches,"], ["10:25", " money, treasures.

For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."], ["10:52", " See, nobody loves the devil. Nobody is really all that interested in serving him,"], ["11:00", " but people do love money, and the things that money can buy you. That's his bait. That's what"], ["11:09", " our flesh wants. What money gets us? People love, serve, worship, wealth and riches,"], ["11:16", " and Paul writes and warns us. In 1 Timothy chapter 6, \"The love of money is the"], ["11:20", " root of all kinds of evil for by which some have strayed from the faith,\" and I thought about that"], ["11:27", " even as you were sharing that prayer request.

The love of money, people stray"], ["11:40", " from the faith, instead of believing in God and putting their devotion and their faith in the"], ["11:45", " wealth and the riches. And that's how Babylon is described. That's the description. Look at"], ["11:50", " chapter 18 verse number 9, as we see the details of what Babylon is, verse number 9. The Kings of"], ["11:58", " the earth. Revelation 18 verse 9, \"Commit of fornication and live luxuriously with her will weep"], ["12:06", " and laments for her when they see the smoke of her burning, standing at a distance for fear of"], ["12:11", " her torment, saying, 'Alas, alas, the great city Babylon, the mighty city for one hour your"], ["12:17", " judgment has come, and the merchants of the earth will weep and moor over her, for no one buys"], ["12:22", " their merchandise anymore. Murchin dice of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen,"], ["12:28", " purple silk, scarlet, every kind of citron wood, every kind of object of ivory, every kind of"], ["12:34", " object of most precious wood, bronze, iron, marble, cinnamon, incense, fragrant oil and Frankenstein,"], ["12:41", " wine and oil, fine flower, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, bodies and souls of men"], ["12:49", " are all sold in Babylon. Well, we know all about that. Don't we, Jennifer, bodies and souls"], ["12:55", " being sold? The fruit that your soul longs for have gone from you and all the things which are"], ["13:03", " rich and splendid have gone from you, and you shall find them no more at all. The merchants of"], ["13:09", " these things who became rich by her will stand at a distance for fear of retirement weeping and"], ["13:13", " wailing and saying, 'Alas, the last, that great city that was clothed in the linen's purple and"], ["13:17", " scarlet adorned with the gold and the stones and the pearls for one hour such great riches came to"], ["13:23", " nothing, every shipmaster all who traveled by sea sailors. It has many trade on the sea,"], ["13:30", " stood at a distance, cried aloud when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, 'What is like"], ["13:35", " this great city?' They threw dust on their heads and they cried weeping and wailing, saying,"], ["13:39", " 'Alas, the last, that great city in which all who had ships of the sea became rich by her wealth"], ["13:46", " for in those hour she has made desolate. Everyone loves Babylon because of the wealth and everyone"], ["13:54", " mourns its destruction because it means they're all financially wiped out.' So with that"], ["14:01", " understanding, let me expound on this for a moment. The devil has studied us and he knows"], ["14:12", " what our flesh desires, what we crave, what we lust for. Most of what we need and want is"], ["14:18", " available to us through the disciplines of working hard and serving others. If we want to be loved"], ["14:25", " and accepted, we can serve others, help others through caring about other people, people recognize"], ["14:31", " the kindness and they reciprocate it. Scripture says to have a friend, you need to be a friend,"], ["14:36", " love and you will be loved, give and it will be given to you. Well, the same is true with physical"], ["14:42", " needs. If I want food or some physical item that brings me some creature comfort, then I have"], ["14:49", " to put some effort into obtaining the goods or making the item. I think I'd like a new sweater."], ["14:56", " Well, I'd better get busy knitting one. I don't know how to knit, I'd better learn how to knit."], ["15:03", " If someone else is already good at knitting, then maybe I can get them to make one for me. If I"], ["15:08", " could exchange it for something that they want, that I have. Most everything we desire is available"], ["15:15", " to us through the disciplines of working hard and serving others. That's what a job is. You're trading"], ["15:20", " your skills and effort away for money that you can use in exchange for someone else's goods and"], ["15:26", " services. That's the basics of the economy. Nothing wrong with any of that. Money in and of itself"], ["15:32", " is neither good or bad. God made some of his most faithful servants very wealthy. Abraham,"], ["15:38", " Joe, David, Solomon, the most wealthiest person ever to live. The problem arises when we love money,"], ["15:47", " when we love stuff more than people, when we love ourselves more than others. This is the flesh"], ["15:55", " at work. Our sin nature, which we're all born with, these attitudes get us into trouble."], ["16:01", " You covet and you lost and you want something that belongs to someone else and they don't really"], ["16:05", " want to give it to you. They don't want to sell it to you maybe because you don't have anything"], ["16:09", " they want. Maybe you didn't work hard enough to get enough money. Maybe you haven't developed your"], ["16:14", " skills to be in high demand. Instead of working hard to gain the item or being content with what"], ["16:21", " you do have, you get upset as you can't get your way. That is when the devil comes along and he"], ["16:28", " offers you the shortcut. Hey, here's how you can get what you want. You just take it."], ["16:34", " You just steal it, right? If anybody confronts you, you just lie about that. If that person"], ["16:43", " persists, well, you're just threatened them with violence. Get other people to join you and you"], ["16:46", " could gang up on them. If they try to fight back, you can just kill them. The devil uses the"], ["16:52", " lust of the flesh to tempt us to sin against God and to one another. That messes up our lives"], ["16:57", " because now we're in all this conflict with others and this messes up other people's lives because"], ["17:01", " now they're reacting to the offenses that we have caused and the peace and love is gone,"], ["17:06", " the cooperation is gone and there's just nothing about fighting in wars and worst of all,"], ["17:13", " messes up our relationship with God because he's going to judge us for all this sin."], ["17:17", " Now, the average person when you come across, they don't really want that much conflict."], ["17:25", " They don't want to steal and kill people. Nor are they influential enough to get a whole"], ["17:31", " bunch of people to join them to create a gang and gang up on other people. And when people"], ["17:35", " understand that they're going to have to answer the God for how they live their lives,"], ["17:38", " it kind of makes them want to behave themselves. But there was this one guy in particular"], ["17:43", " that noticed he was the strongest person in the world and he could get people to submit to him"], ["17:51", " and his name was Nimrod, the mighty hunter. There's a new Marvel movie coming out called Craven,"], ["17:59", " the hunter. I haven't seen it. This is not an endorsement, but back in the day I used to collect"], ["18:05", " Spider-Man comics, so I know who Craven is. He's the alpha. He hunts and he kills with his bare"], ["18:10", " hands, the most dangerous animals in the world, 10 foot power bears, lions, bull elephants,"], ["18:16", " but Craven doesn't just hunt animals. He hunts people and he kills anyone who defies him."], ["18:21", " That's he's a villain and that's what that's who Nimrod was in the Old Testament."], ["18:27", " Revelation chapter or Genesis chapter 10 coming off of the arc after the great flood,"], ["18:32", " there was this one family that just grew and multiplied and the great grandson of Noah"], ["18:37", " realized I'm the strongest dude on the planet. Nimrod, the mighty hunter, not a hunter of deer"], ["18:44", " or ducks, a hunter of people. He was the alpha. He overpowered everybody and he took control of"], ["18:50", " society and people submitted to him and he built cities in a society where the strong ruled the"], ["18:57", " weak and due to his power, he became very arrogant. So arrogant, he did not fear God. Remember,"], ["19:04", " he was the great grandson of Noah, the grandson of Ham, who survived the great flood. So he knew"], ["19:09", " all about God wiping out mankind for the wickedness. He did not care. He rebelled against the"], ["19:13", " decrees of God and created a religion and a society that gave power to the few to rule the many."], ["19:21", " The powerful would rule because they were superior and even Godlike and he claimed himself to be"], ["19:27", " a God. Babylon is the first city that he built and once Nimrod built the system, people"], ["19:35", " perpetually figured out how to use it, grow it and expand it. So like Nimrod can personally"], ["19:41", " overpower people who defy him. So everyone will obey him and fall in line. But since there's a"], ["19:46", " lot of people in the world that he wants to organize and rule, he has to delegate someone to rule"], ["19:51", " on his behalf. And so he'll reward that person with riches and loyalty. And so now we have a way"], ["19:58", " to transfer power to other people. There's a mechanism that controls and manages the masses."], ["20:05", " It's to consolidate wealth and power and puts it into the hands of a few. It's stronger than any one"], ["20:10", " person. It's the will of people united society. Why does anyone want to be a part of that?"], ["20:18", " Because of peace. Mankind built an unjust society and that was excellent for the devil. See,"], ["20:26", " the devil's not physical. So he can't do anything physically to you. He can't make something physical"], ["20:32", " that you want that he'll give it to you. What he needs is people to do things for him. Do things"], ["20:39", " that he wants them to do on his behalf. So Nimrod created a system and then he exploits it."], ["20:44", " Within this order, people can become great and have whatever they want. They can try to rule the"], ["20:49", " world. They write the laws, the decrees that everyone now has to be abiding by. All the devil"], ["20:56", " had to do was influence his people to take control of that system. So powerful kings could lead"], ["21:01", " armies out to conquer other people, take their land, their livestock and slave their people to work"], ["21:07", " to build their empires. Ancient empires were all about taking over other people and slaving folks"], ["21:13", " so they could consolidate power and grow wealth. Many people got hurt by it, but on the other hand,"], ["21:19", " a lot of people profited from it. Those people wanted it. If their nation, their country's winning,"], ["21:23", " they get wealthy and they were happy to participate in a society where the strong ruled the weak."], ["21:30", " This is not at all what God wants.

I want to see God as loving and kind."], ["00:55", " I want to feel good about Him. How can I praise and rejoice about a God who's so harsh?"], ["01:05", " Let's talk about that. Shall we? Look at Revelation chapter 18, turn to Revelation chapter"], ["01:12", " 18 and the context of verses 1 through 4. After these things, John's rights, I saw an angel"], ["01:19", " coming down from heaven, having great authority.

For all the nations have drunk the wine of the wrath"], ["01:40", " of her fornication. The kings of the earth are committed fornication with her. The merchants"], ["01:45", " of the earth have become rich through the abundance of her luxuries. And I heard another"], ["01:49", " voice from heaven saying, \"Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, lest"], ["01:54", " you receive of her plagues.\" The heavenly being calls this one world empire, Babylon. It"], ["02:01", " is a luxurious, decadent, immoral empire that gratifies the flesh and glorifies self."], ["02:08", " To the extent that the leader, the Antichrist, exalts himself as God and everyone is killed,"], ["02:15", " who does not worship him? Look at that, at the end of the chapter verse 24, chapter 18,"], ["02:21", " it says there. And in her was found the blood of the prophets and the saints and all who"], ["02:28", " were slain on the earth. All the leaders of the world went along with these lies and"], ["02:35", " injustice because they were getting rich. Can you imagine governments being corrupt, allowing"], ["02:43", " people to suffer and die so they could have money and power? What? Shocking. Sort of"], ["02:50", " like when elected officials go to Washington, D.C. to be public servants, been ended up"], ["02:54", " being millionaires. Can you imagine how that happens? Anyways, let's look at some observations"], ["02:59", " here, verse number 9, 18, verse number 9, the kings of the earth who committed fornication,"], ["03:05", " lived luxuriously with her, they'll weep and lament for her when they see the smoke of"], ["03:10", " her burning, standing at a distance for fear of the torments, saying, alas, alas, the"], ["03:15", " great city Babylon, that mighty city.

But then it says, rejoice over her, O heavens, you apostles and prophets for"], ["04:00", " God has avenged you on her and then a mighty angel took the stone with the great millstone"], ["04:05", " and threw it into the sea, saying, thus, with violence, the great city Babylon, shall"], ["04:12", " be thrown down and shall not be found anymore. The sound of the harpedists, the musicians,"], ["04:18", " the fluteists, the trumpeters shall not be heard in you anymore. No craftsmen of any craft shall"], ["04:22", " be found in you anymore.

For your merchants were the great men"], ["04:36", " of the earth, for by your sorcery, all the nations were deceived and in her was found"], ["04:41", " the blood of the prophets and the saints in all who were slain on the earth. So we see"], ["04:47", " in this passage two very different reactions to God's judgment. The reactions teach us"], ["04:54", " something about these people. What are the two reactions? Verse number nine, what is it? What"], ["05:03", " are they doing? They weep and they lament. And then in verse number ten, they're crying,"], ["05:10", " alas, alas, and they're wailing over the city. Verse number eleven, it says it again."], ["05:18", " The merchants will weep and mourn over her. Look at that verse number fifteen, says it again."], ["05:24", " What does it say? They stand a way out of way, distance saying, weeping and wailing, and"], ["05:30", " then verse nineteen, yet again, weeping and wailing, crying for the city over and over."], ["05:36", " It is repeated that they're weeping and mourning. Scripture, biblical authors, repeat themselves"], ["05:44", " for the sake of emphasis. They really want us to understand this detail. So weeping over"], ["05:51", " the judgments is one reaction we see. What is the other reaction? Yeah, verse number twenty,"], ["06:00", " what did verse twenty say? Read joys over her heavens and you holy apostles and prophets."], ["06:07", " Read joys over her. That is the Greek word you far out. It's where we get our English"], ["06:14", " word, euphoria, euphoria. That means elation, ecstasy, jubilation. Woo-hoo! Look at Bible"], ["06:26", " I'm burned, burned, baby, burned. They're cheering and dancing. Today we want to talk about"], ["06:34", " the judgments, the wrath of God, and how we feel about it. There's a great deal of debate"], ["06:42", " over justice these days. There have been all kinds of laws on the books that have not been"], ["06:47", " enforced. Laws that have been broken and law enforcement was told to stand down, let"], ["06:55", " it go, turn a blind eye. There's been no judgment. There's been no punishment and this"], ["07:00", " is wrech havoc on businesses, destroying property values, making people feel very unsafe in"], ["07:06", " their own communities. There has been a lack of justice in our land. Last week we learned"], ["07:13", " Micah 68. Do justly love, mercy, and walk humbly. Do justly. What does that mean? Just"], ["07:26", " is defined as what is right or as things should be. Acting in accordance with stated"], ["07:33", " laws or rules adherence to customs, the fulfillment of duty towards God and fellow man. That's"], ["07:41", " the definition of just. When I was in Bible school, I was supposed to read the student"], ["07:50", " conduct agreement, sign it, date it, and adhere to it. I was supposed to follow the rules."], ["07:58", " You know, I had to fill in a bunch of application forms, so I signed this, and I signed"], ["08:04", " that, and I didn't really read it even thoroughly because I was 18, and then I paid attention"], ["08:09", " to details, and 53, and I still don't really pay attention to details. If you send me a"], ["08:14", " long email, brother John, I'm probably not even going to read all the way down through"], ["08:17", " it. It's embarrassing. I know. Anyways, it didn't take long that I got called in because"], ["08:23", " I was violating the student conduct agreement. Typically, once a semester, the Dean"], ["08:30", " of Men would invite me into his office. Brother Rob, great man of the faith, and discuss"], ["08:36", " my infractions. You know, Pastor Mark and I went to college together. I assure you,"], ["08:43", " Pastor Mark was much better at following the rules than I was. I don't remember him ever"], ["08:50", " getting in trouble, so I want you all to be thankful that you have one pastor who is"], ["08:55", " wholesome. Big nerd, sorry. Yeah, exactly. But since I wouldn't get my dorm job done,"], ["09:08", " or I snuck in after curfew, or I tossed a bag of garbage out the third story window into"], ["09:14", " the dumpster, instead of carrying it all the way down the stairs, you know, I'd end up"], ["09:19", " with either a fine or maintenance work detail. The Dean of Men would pass a judgment,"], ["09:24", " I'd be given a punishment to help me motivate me to stop breaking the rules. Likewise, if"], ["09:30", " I didn't get an assignment in on time, I'd get a percentage reduction of my grade, and"], ["09:36", " that was the punishment for not completing the assignment on time. And when this happened"], ["09:41", " to me, you know what I never said, this is not fair. Those professors are wrong. I"], ["09:49", " mean, the deans out to get me, man, these people, they're just biased against Canadians."], ["09:56", " Just don't like Canadians around here. I never thought that. I knew full well I was getting"], ["10:01", " what I deserved because the truth was I was in the wrong. I was breaking the rules, and"], ["10:07", " I got caught. Matter of fact, I was generally relieved that I only got two hours of maintenance"], ["10:16", " duty or a three-dollar fine. It got off easy because I got to wait with way more infractions"], ["10:23", " than they ever caught me on. If the letter of the law had been followed, I'd have been"], ["10:30", " kicked out of school. And that would have been just. Actually, in my junior year, a couple"], ["10:33", " of my friends did get kicked out. And that really kind of woke me up. I recognized, ooh,"], ["10:39", " that could have been me. And I thought, how embarrassing that would be for my parents. You"], ["10:43", " know, what shame I would feel going back to my little tiny community in New Brunswick, Canada."], ["10:49", " And everybody knowing I got kicked out of Bible school. The judgment on my classmates, what"], ["10:55", " they suffered, that got my attention, and it made me conclude, I need to smarten up. I need"], ["11:00", " to stop acting like a punk, and then he did act more like, Markle you. That's why we hired"], ["11:11", " Pastor Mark, right? To be a good influence on me. The punishment, the judgment that my"], ["11:19", " classmates received, it impacted me and helped me straighten out to do justly. In order"], ["11:25", " to do justly, you have to know right from wrong. And when you do wrong and people confront"], ["11:32", " you with it, doing justly means that you admit your failure, your violations, and you"], ["11:39", " change. And senior year, I did not have any more visits to the Dean of Students. I made"], ["11:45", " a concerted effort to change my behavior. And overall, everyone was much happier with me."], ["11:50", " My senior year, I got better grades. My teachers were pleased that the department head complimented"], ["11:56", " me on my efforts. Yeah, but what about those other guys who got booted out? How was that"], ["12:02", " fair that you got to stay and they got expelled? Maybe they would have shaped up if they"], ["12:08", " had been given another chance. Maybe they would have. Or maybe we would have continued on"], ["12:13", " acting up and dragged more students down into our vortex of insubordination. But they"], ["12:20", " were my friends. They were cool guys. People don't like it when justice is served, when"], ["12:29", " it's hurting themselves in some way. And when people feel bad about other people getting"], ["12:36", " hurt, we feel bad about people feeling bad, right? You know, kid fails to task.

Since there was upset children and"], ["13:45", " parents were upset, seeing their children upset, the rules were changed. No child left"], ["13:50", " behind. Now we got a bunch of kids in high school who don't know how to read. And that's"], ["13:56", " not just. There's a bunch of kids disrupting the classes and they don't listen to the"], ["14:01", " teachers and they're never expelled and the teachers can't teach and the other students"], ["14:05", " can't learn. And that's not just. And certain cities have so much shoplifting.

I mean, they just went hard, it was a hard fought game,"], ["03:08", " but that night the KCA boys prevailed, and we ended the season with the big win,"], ["03:15", " and so driving home, Tony and I, we were pumped, you know, I was pumped, he was"], ["03:20", " pumped, and we were talking about you know all the plays, and you know how you do"], ["03:24", " that after you had a big win, you kind of rehash the whole thing, and we were in"], ["03:29", " the house, and he was on the stairway, and we were talking, I was standing here in"], ["03:34", " the living room, we were talking about the whole thing, and he was gonna go up"], ["03:37", " to take a shower, and we were kind of winding down, and I looked at him and it"], ["03:43", " dawned on me that after 14 years, that was the last time I was gonna coach him or"], ["03:50", " any of my sons in sports ever again, and just like that, one of my favorite"], ["03:57", " parts of being a dad was over, and then even more so, I didn't realize how"], ["04:04", " quickly my time with my dear friend Bobby Joy was coming to an end, and just"], ["04:13", " gonna have to forgive me for getting in my fields every once a while up here,"], ["04:16", " because there's been 18 years of doing this stuff, and being a dad and being in"], ["04:20", " community, and there's a lot of memories that get, you know, get in here, and I"], ["04:25", " got to get them out, but what a great time I had putting my kids in sports, ever"], ["04:32", " since my oldest, we put him in hockey when he was five, that was 18 years of"], ["04:37", " coaching and cheering and bonding, and then one day it was over, and I never did"], ["04:43", " it again. Can you do you recognize when you are in the midst of something"], ["04:49", " special? At some point in your childhood, you and your friends went outside"], ["04:54", " to play together for the last time, and nobody knew it was the last time. There"], ["05:00", " was one day where you put your child down, your toddler, and you never picked them"], ["05:06", " up again. That was the last time you ever picked them up. And this is what time"], ["05:13", " does to us. It waits for nobody, it punishes us like a way blowing into the shore,"], ["05:19", " it washes away our dreams, and it happens right in front of our faces, and often"], ["05:24", " we don't even know it's the last time when it is the last time. Revelation"], ["05:30", " chapter 20, turn to Revelation chapter 20, it shows us the future. I know"], ["05:36", " the future we are learning the future. Revelation chapter 20 talks about this"], ["05:41", " amazing time. We learned about it last week, it's called the Millennial Kingdom."], ["05:46", " It's a time of peace and safety where everyone has their own land and nobody's"], ["05:52", " warring over anybody's land. There's just long life and healing, there's joy"], ["05:56", " and prosperity. Creation has been restored. The prophet Isaiah talks about how"], ["06:02", " the wolf will dwell with the lamb and the lion will lie down with a young goat"], ["06:07", " and a calf and a young lion will play together and then a little child will"], ["06:11", " lead them all. So the fear and the violence of the animal kingdom is all gone in"], ["06:17", " the Millennial Kingdom, the carnivores or buddies with the herb of wars and a"], ["06:20", " little child can play with what would be considered wild dishes animals today."], ["06:24", " And that's just a great summary of how peaceful, how safe it is and everyone"], ["06:32", " knows God and holiness abounds and nobody sins and nobody's lying and Jesus"], ["06:38", " is rolling and Satan is bound and everyone's having a great time. And then what"], ["06:43", " happens? Revelation chapter 20 verse number seven, when the thousand years"], ["06:49", " expired, Satan will be released from his prison. He will go out to deceive the"], ["06:55", " nations which are in the four corners of the earth. Gog and May Gog to gather"], ["06:59", " them together to battle whose number is as the sand of the sea. They went up"], ["07:05", " on the breath of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved"], ["07:10", " city and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them and the devil"], ["07:15", " who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and"], ["07:18", " the false prophet are and they'll be tormented day and night forever and ever."], ["07:24", " What just happens? It's probably one of the saddest most"], ["07:31", " lowest points in human history. One of the hardest passages of Scripture to"], ["07:37", " comprehend is chapter 20. The second half of Revelation chapter 20, but as you"], ["07:43", " know, since I preach chapter and verse, we don't get to skip the hard passages."], ["07:50", " So, like it or not, we got to deal with the final rebellion and the Gog, May"], ["07:56", " Gog battle. First thing we observe here is Satan's released and he was chained up"], ["08:03", " for a thousand years but now he's released and he's permitted to deceive the"], ["08:07", " nations one more time. So, at this point, all the people who survived their great"], ["08:13", " tribulation, some people from all nations managed to survive somehow and all"], ["08:18", " these people are in the millennial kingdom and they repopulate the earth and"], ["08:22", " since people are living in pre-flood conditions where there's no disease and"], ["08:26", " there's extended life, they got like a thousand years to repopulate. That's a"], ["08:33", " lot of reproducing, isn't it? We're pretty good at that here at faith Bible"], ["08:37", " Church. We're always reproducing, somebody's always having a baby.

We need more people but there's a"], ["08:50", " lot of people being born. So, a straightforward read of Revelation makes it"], ["08:54", " seem like anyone who is already in heaven, return with Jesus with the armies"], ["08:58", " and they're reigning with him in the millennial kingdom and I don't know what"], ["09:01", " kind of bodies we're going to be given. Are we going to have new perfect"], ["09:05", " physical bodies that can resume living earthly lives or do we have a different"], ["09:10", " type of resurrected body more like Jesus after he rose from the dead where he"], ["09:15", " could touch things, he could be touched, he could eat but he could also appear"], ["09:19", " and disappear. You got to understand we just don't have a great wealth of"], ["09:23", " details given to us about this time. We see in the millennial kingdom all the"], ["09:27", " Old Testament prophecies have been fulfilled and people have land and they"], ["09:32", " have blessings and they're having children and I'm just not sure how resurrected"], ["09:36", " saints will function in the kingdom. I suspect our faith has made us whole"], ["09:41", " and we're immune to what is about to happen. So, what happens is all these"], ["09:49", " people born during the millennial kingdom, they've not had to deal with the"], ["09:54", " temptations of an evil world. They've had not, they didn't have to deal with"], ["09:58", " the temptations of the devil or evil spirits. They're not having to deal with"], ["10:04", " the curse of sin on the land and toil and labor to survive and disease is"], ["10:08", " afflicting them. They've had all these advantages. Nevertheless, they're still"], ["10:14", " physical and so they're born with a sin nature and in the millennial kingdom"], ["10:21", " we learned in Revelation chapter 19 verse 15 that Jesus is ruling with a"], ["10:27", " rod of iron.

Because if you want to, you want to sin now, I mean you could steal and"], ["11:29", " forticate and cheat lying, kill people and get hammered and it's very easy to"], ["11:33", " be a pagan and to worship other gods and to just glorify yourself, right?"], ["11:37", " People build our own kingdoms and we feed our lust and we consume whatever makes"], ["11:43", " us feel good. You know, if you wanted to, next weekend, go to Vegas and go crazy,"], ["11:49", " right? And just book a flight and just go over there and step off the plane and welcome to"], ["11:52", " the jungle. We've got fun and games. We get everything you want. If we know your"], ["11:56", " names, we have the people that spy, whatever we may need. If you've got the money"], ["11:59", " honey, we got your disease. Our world is sin and vice everywhere. Well, my kingdom is"], ["12:09", " not so. It's people, the people in the millennial kingdom and to those people, this world"], ["12:16", " that we live in right now, this thing would seem like a once upon a time unbelievable fairy tale,"], ["12:22", " like, oh Lord of the Rings world or something, completely foreign. People who grow up with a millennial"], ["12:28", " kingdom would ask, what was life like on earth when Jesus wasn't raining? And then we would reply,"], ["12:35", " oh man, it was a mess. People were getting sick and dying and there was just all this war and"], ["12:40", " violence and people would just rip each other off and the governments were corrupt and"], ["12:45", " folks were using and abusing themselves and others and on the one hand, that would just sound"], ["12:50", " shockingly terrible.

So this is the environment that Satan is released back into,"], ["16:03", " a whole world of people who've been living under a very strict environment, they want a sin,"], ["16:09", " they got no opportunity to do so. And this is what happens after a thousand years expired,"], ["16:15", " verse seven, Satan's released and he goes out and deceives the nations, which are in the four"], ["16:19", " corners of the earth, Gogamega gathered them together for a battle whose number is as the"], ["16:26", " sand of the sea.

This time we're adding two more"], ["01:19", " daughter-in-laws to the entourage and I'm a little concerned. What if the trip"], ["01:26", " is not as great as we made it to be?

What if after all that they conclude,"], ["02:06", " yeah Canada's just not as cool as I remembered it?\" I had this personal"], ["02:12", " philosophy that it is best to undersell and overproduce.

I mean that's pretty"], ["02:28", " well how all my sermons hit, right? People come in here, they look at me, they're"], ["02:33", " kind of not sure, kind of skeptical, but by the time I wrap up and say, \"Man, they"], ["02:37", " all I was better than I expected.\" That's the secret of my staying power. I'm"], ["02:43", " surprisingly competent, unexpectedly articulate, and un-predictably"], ["02:48", " knowledgeable. I think I just crafted a new tagline for the website, a"], ["02:55", " pastor Rob McNutt, surprisingly competent, unexpectedly articulate, un-predictably"], ["03:02", " knowledgeable. I undersell overproduce. That's how I roll. So I'm kind of"], ["03:09", " worried that maybe for the last six years we have oversold the awesomeness of"], ["03:14", " the trip to Canada. And I think we should dial back our expectations 50%"], ["03:19", " because, well, we're going in July and it may or may not be warm. It'll definitely"], ["03:25", " rain, especially if you go to the beach. Every time I've ever been to the beach"], ["03:28", " you can, I'm a whole life, it ranks. So you take a blanket, not to sit on, to wrap"], ["03:32", " yourself in, to try to say warm. Since the government of Canada has had 10 years"], ["03:36", " of insanity, free drugs, and soaring taxes, things are very expensive right now."], ["03:41", " And there's way more homelessness and drug addictions than we've ever seen"], ["03:45", " before.

Fun"], ["03:53", " fact, trailer park boys was shot in a trailer park from my hometown. So I"], ["03:59", " remember poor, but I don't remember homeless people, drug addicts,"], ["04:03", " struggled on the streets. That's a newer phenomena. So Canada has hit a rough"], ["04:08", " patch. And Canadians who are stereotypically polite, but all this talk about"], ["04:13", " tariffs and becoming the 51st stay, they're a little spooled up and cranky about"], ["04:17", " all that. Buying the US national anthem at hockey games, so they might be more"], ["04:25", " sarcastic than usual. When we go to visit this time. So on top of all that, this"], ["04:31", " is 50 hours of driving, and we're all staying, so in the cars together that long"], ["04:37", " and then staying together in the same houses, getting some Airbnb's, all those"], ["04:42", " personalities, there's no chance of drama, right? So we'll see. Either way, it's"], ["04:49", " gonna be an interesting trip. Stay tuned. I'll give you summary in July. So we"], ["04:54", " have been learning about eternity. The new heaven, the new earth, the new"], ["04:59", " Jerusalem. We do not have a huge amount of information in the Bible, so this"], ["05:03", " often leaves people the opportunity to romanticize, fantasize about what that"], ["05:08", " will be like. Some people think we're gonna be like angels. We're gonna have"], ["05:11", " wings. We're gonna fly around, play harps and sit on clouds. Other people think"], ["05:16", " of the millennial kingdom descriptions that talk about a peaceful, perfect"], ["05:21", " environment, and how we're all in harmony with nature. You know, the lying"], ["05:25", " laying down with the lamb. It's like, oh, what? The earth's gonna be just a big"], ["05:29", " petting zoo. Is that what it's gonna be like? Some people like the description of"], ["05:33", " having their own land and it being very productive. All the homesteaders in here"], ["05:36", " looking forward to their, their guarded and their chickens and their little mini"], ["05:39", " cows giving their milks. I mean, like that stuff. Other people think of waterfront"], ["05:44", " property and fishing all day. Something like the idea of the city. You know, lots"], ["05:47", " to see and do. And of course, living in cross proximity to Jesus, that sounds"], ["05:51", " great. Some like me think of the feasts, like how Isaiah describes it.

We got"], ["06:31", " jokes today. You know, the things that we, we like, right? I think we visualize"], ["06:38", " all the fun things we enjoy and we package it all together. If it's cool and"], ["06:41", " exciting, if it sounds like a great vacation, that's what we think surely that"], ["06:45", " will be in heaven.

Look at verse number 15. \"And the Lord God said, it is not good that man be alone,"], ["18:44", " I will make a 15.\" Then the Lord God spoke to man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend it"], ["18:53", " and keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying, \"Every tree of the garden you may freely eat,"], ["18:58", " but the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall now eat for in the day that you eat of it,"], ["19:03", " you will surely die.\" Was he allowed to eat of the tree of life?"], ["19:09", " It's only one tree he said no to eat from, the tree of knowledge of good and evil could eat in the"], ["19:14", " tree of life. Yeah. Interesting that the garden of Eden had a river and a tree of life,"], ["19:22", " and so does the New Jerusalem. It's almost like we would go right back to where we started,"], ["19:25", " from Genesis Revelation, we're right back in that same place. But there's no tree of knowledge of good"], ["19:32", " and evil in the New Jerusalem. Now turn to chapter 3, Genesis chapter 3 and verse number 21,"], ["19:40", " after man had disobeyed, after he'd eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil."], ["19:43", " Chapter 3, verse 21, it says verse 22, \"And the Lord said, behold, man has become like us,"], ["19:55", " like one of us, to know good from evil. Now lest he put his hand and take also the tree of life,"], ["20:00", " and eat and live forever, therefore God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground"], ["20:06", " on which he was taken.\" So he drove him out and then he put an angel there with the sword to protect it."], ["20:10", " So based on what God said, the tree of life has fruit that if you eat a bit, you live for"], ["20:18", " forever. And once again, we see in Revelation the tree provides fruit for nourishment"], ["20:25", " and the leaves provide what does it say? Did you catch that? The leaves are for healing."], ["20:31", " Many plants have medicinal properties. This tree has a super fruit, food, and it has"], ["20:38", " medicinal properties as well. And so this is what sustains life forever in eternity."], ["20:46", " Also trees, they're in their leaves are essential for what? What do they make that we need?"], ["20:52", " This is science. Oxygen, somebody whispered it, there's oxygen. We need oxygen to leave."], ["21:00", " So everything we need to survive. Everything that God created us that we need, we need food,"], ["21:06", " we need water, we need shelter, and we need oxygen and all that in the New Jerusalem is providing."], ["21:13", " It's all right here in this passage. By the way, I forgot to remind you what the name of the city"], ["21:18", " actually means in Hebrew. And I should have did that last week. So let's catch up on that."], ["21:23", " People typically say Jerusalem means city of peace, foundation of peace. Unfortunately,"], ["21:30", " the Jerusalem that we know today is not like that. As in fact, as the prophet Zarek, Zach"], ["21:35", " Reyer, foretold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of drunkenness to all the surrounding people they"], ["21:40", " see against Judah and Jerusalem. It'll happen on that day that I'll make Jerusalem a heavy stone"], ["21:46", " for all the people. I'll do try to heat it away, we'll be cut the pieces, all the nations of"], ["21:50", " the earth gather against it. And we see that in our day and age, don't we? That Israel,"], ["21:55", " that Jerusalem is not a peaceful place. That there is all this debate of who should control the"], ["21:59", " city, and especially who should control the temple mount up there. And it is the most volatile"], ["22:04", " peace of real estate on the entire planet. Just as the prophet Zarek Reyer said, a cup of"], ["22:10", " trembling, a cup of drunkenness. But this new Jerusalem in Revelation is not to be confused with"], ["22:17", " the Jerusalem that we know today. New Jerusalem will be a city that showcases peace,"], ["22:22", " peace we will have with one another, and peace we will have with God. That's something we need."], ["22:28", " Don't we? We lack that so much. I got saying earlier, going to go up to Canada, kind of tense up"], ["22:34", " there. They're not feeling a lot of peace right now with us. But even in our own country,"], ["22:40", " there's a lack of peace within our own population. You notice that? We notice the Thursday,"], ["22:46", " we went to the March for Life up in Annapolis, and we marched through the streets, and we went"], ["22:51", " up to the big capital building there of state of Maryland, and they were doing prayers, and they"], ["22:57", " were doing songs, and we were pledging the flag, and we were doing some speeches up there."], ["23:02", " And the whole time we were doing that, there was people in the back, and the police had kind of"], ["23:08", " separated, and they were back there, and they were screaming, and they were yelling, and they"], ["23:13", " were trying to disrupt the whole thing, and when we were marching through the streets, people were"], ["23:18", " yelling accusations, and curses against the marchers, and our country is not at peace, is it?"], ["23:26", " Just within our own people, and we can even zoom in on that and get even closer to home."], ["23:32", " What about our workplaces? What about our churches? What about our own families? Is there strife?"], ["23:40", " Is there disunity? Sometimes we can't even go to church without getting in a fight"], ["23:47", " on the way, pulling the parking lot. It's like, \"Ahh.\" And then, \"Oh, hi. How you doing?\""], ["23:51", " Put the face on. Paul instructs us in Ephesians chapter 4. He says,"], ["23:58", " \"I beseech you to walk worthy of the calling that you're called.\" Oh, yeah? What's that look like?"], ["24:02", " Paul, how do we do that? With all loneliness, gentleness, long suffering, bearing one another in love,"], ["24:09", " endeavoring to keep the unity and the spirit in the bond of peace, and then he elaborates. There's"], ["24:15", " one body, one spirit, you're called a one hope you're calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism,"], ["24:22", " one God and Father of all, was above all, through all, and in you all. That is our goal"], ["24:29", " within our church, within our own homes, as followers of Jesus, to keep the unity of the spirit"], ["24:36", " in the bond of peace. Are you striving for that goal? Are you walking worthy of your calling, as Paul"], ["24:41", " says? It only works. If we utilize the fruits of the spirit that he listed here, patience, gentleness,"], ["24:49", " loneliness, bearing one another in love, we can't do peace in our own strength, in our own flesh."], ["24:55", " And Paul reminds us why we are to keep working on it. Why? Because we're all one, one body,"], ["25:05", " one household, one family, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, we all need each other, and we all"], ["25:13", " need to aspire to produce the bond of peace. But I discovered another layer of interpretation"], ["25:21", " to the meaning of the name Jerusalem, city of peace. But there's something a little deeper here,"], ["25:28", " I wanted to take a moment, if you'll allow me. Remember Hebrew, the original writings, they don't"], ["25:36", " have vowels in their words. They just have consonants, and most Hebrew words have a three consonant"], ["25:42", " roots, and then they add prefixes and suffixes to fill it out. Jerusalem is actually a compound"], ["25:50", " word. It's two roots put together. So the first word is yeru, which as a verb can mean flow."], ["26:00", " And so the application of that is like the flowing water of a river. Well, we already talked about"], ["26:06", " rivers. The throwing of something, as it's being flowed out of the hand, or even the flowing of"], ["26:11", " a finger in the sense that it's pointing as where you should go, yeru. And then shalahim is the word"], ["26:20", " from the root word, shalom means complete and whole. The word shalom is derived from shalom,"], ["26:29", " same consonants, different vowels, and we know shalom means peace, right? So it can be translated"], ["26:36", " peace, but it also carries with it the idea of whole or complete. So when you put those two"], ["26:43", " words together, yeru shalom, the meaning is something like pointing the way to completeness,"], ["26:51", " pointing the way to completeness. So that name and meaning is likewise accurate because when we"], ["26:58", " look at what the water of life does, and we look at what the tree of life does, and what living with"], ["27:03", " God does, it is the way to completeness. Think of that for a moment. Is it not true that no matter"], ["27:15", " what you're doing, what a great thing you're planning, or activity you're embarking on,"], ["27:22", " is there not always a level of incompleteness and dissatisfaction with the whole endeavor?"], ["27:29", " Right? You plan a vacation and you're so excited to get on the road and do the activities,"], ["27:33", " and what do you say after a week and a half of that? I can't wait to get home to sleep in my own bed."], ["27:40", " You know, I'm so hungry, just can't wait to eat, and then once I eat, oh, I'm so full,"], ["27:46", " I can't think of food, I don't even want to think about food. I'm so tired, I need to rest,"], ["27:51", " so I'm sorry to lay it around the house. We gotta get up and go do something. I bought this new thing,"], ["27:55", " whatever it is, it's the coolest thing. It's not that great, buyers regret. You remember the old"], ["28:01", " people, remember the Rolling Stones, they saying, \"Can't get new, sad, is faction.\" King Solomon"], ["28:07", " 3,000 years ago put it another way. He said, \"Vanity, vanity, all vanity.\" There's never a feeling"], ["28:15", " of complete. We're always chasing something. What is it? Why are we so unsettled?"], ["28:23", " Well, there's things we feel lacking. Like, you know, when loved ones pass away, we always"], ["28:28", " feel that. There's always a sense of loss with that. The bigger thing is we're not feeling complete"], ["28:33", " because we're separated from God. That's the main reason why we're not complete. We're separated"], ["28:38", " from God, and we're not even, to be honest with you, we're not even sure how we're supposed to live"], ["28:43", " our lives. Some of your 40 years old's still saying, \"Well, I don't know what to do with my life,"], ["28:47", " I don't know what I'm going to be when I grow up.\" We're never sure. We're always living"], ["28:53", " in a state of incompleteness. The world then, in turn, will throw all these pleasures at us"], ["28:58", " to try to fill those voids. Here, try this stuff.

I know the way to complete this."], ["29:35", " I know the way to this city, among my way, and what is the way Jesus is the way."], ["29:45", " One day, I will be in a place of perfect peace, peace with others, peace with myself,"], ["29:50", " and peace with my Heavenly Father. And what else? The curse will be no more. Did you catch that"], ["29:56", " verse three? The curse will be no more. Which means what? Well, the curse is death.

Pastor Rob, where's all the supposed"], ["02:25", " good? In 2004, my little family lived on the banks of the picturesque Saint John River Valley"], ["02:33", " in New Brunswick, Canada overlooking the water. We could see the power dam from our back deck."], ["02:38", " We had a lovely home. We had a big backyard and a garden and a place set for the kids"], ["02:43", " in a above ground pool of trampoline. I built this big yard swing for Eliana that we"], ["02:49", " pushed the positions right in front of our fire pit and we could have campfires in the"], ["02:53", " evening sitting on the swing and looking up at the stars. The little country church I"], ["02:58", " was pastoring was just across the yard and when we arrived there in 2000, there was about"], ["03:03", " 60 people attending four years later. We doubled that to like 120 people. I know it doesn't"], ["03:08", " sound like a lot but due to the fact there was only 2,500 people in the whole area, 5%"], ["03:13", " of the population was attending our church. So we were doing quite well so it appeared."], ["03:20", " Nevertheless there was conflict within the congregation, stuff predating me but my leadership"], ["03:27", " style forced it to ahead and despite all the good that we were enjoying after four years"], ["03:33", " we knew it was time for a change. The winds of change were blowing and what I observed"], ["03:40", " through that experience was when it's time for a change there's often a push and a"], ["03:47", " pull. It's time for a change you'll experience a push and a pull. There's something"], ["03:53", " good, better, exciting, pulling you onto the next stage of life and there's also something"], ["04:00", " distasteful, upsetting, concerning going on in your current location that's pushing"], ["04:05", " you away from it. So all the conflicts and crankiness and distrust was pushing me out"], ["04:11", " of Canada. Long winter's too. It's just a factor. The hope of new opportunity here in"], ["04:16", " America and harmony with my wife was pulling me in this direction. The vision and hope"], ["04:21", " and the belief that we'd be better down here was the pull, the uncooperative negativity"], ["04:25", " of the folks in my last church was the painful push but they both worked together to get"], ["04:31", " me to move in this direction. Some of you are in the midst of some personal changes. Reflect"], ["04:39", " on what you've experienced and I think you could testify of the painful push but maybe"], ["04:46", " you can't identify the positive pull. Well I hope we're going to be able to show you"], ["04:51", " that but often the painful push, the instinct for us is to initially push back, fight"], ["04:58", " back, to resist the change and desire to keep the good that we remember. The St. John River"], ["05:04", " Valley is still very picturesque. There's aspects of that area that I always will remember"], ["05:08", " with fondness. We did good work up there. We have good friends up there. We have family"], ["05:12", " that we love who actually are visiting now so we get to see them. First time since"], ["05:16", " pre-COVID that I've been able to get together with the family. So that's been awesome."], ["05:22", " But God had something better in mind. And fighting to keep what I liked would have only"], ["05:28", " prolonged getting to what was better. Resisting the change because I wanted to keep the"], ["05:33", " good, what have meant denying myself what was best. So we're now starting a new study"], ["05:40", " in the book of Hebrews. Now we don't know who wrote the book of Hebrews but we know it"], ["05:47", " was before the fall of the temple in 70 AD so it's estimated to be written in around 65 AD."], ["05:53", " 25 years after the setting of the book of Luke that we just finished studying, the audience,"], ["05:58", " the recipients of the book are primarily Hebrews and they're Jews. So what is the life"], ["06:07", " setting of Jews in 65 AD? So after the resurrection and the ascension of Jesus, the disciples"], ["06:14", " were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to do signs and wonders and preach the name"], ["06:17", " of Jesus. Jesus gave his disciples the Great Commission at Acts 1 verse number 8. You will"], ["06:22", " receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,"], ["06:27", " Judea, Samaria and to the outermost parts of the earth. So as Jesus stated, the church"], ["06:33", " started in Jerusalem but it would then move from there to different parts of the nation"], ["06:37", " of Israel eventually to spread to the whole earth. And it takes a while to get to the"], ["06:42", " whole earth. We're still working on that even today. But in the beginning, a great many"], ["06:47", " Jews came to believe in Jesus as the Messiah. There was this huge instant conversion Peter"], ["06:53", " got up and preached at Pentecost and 3,000 people believed in Jesus in one day. And after"], ["06:59", " that, Acts says they added to their numbers daily. So there's a big 3,000 people came"], ["07:04", " and then they just kept more people kept getting saved. All of these people were Jews."], ["07:10", " They were Jews nationally and culturally and even religiously because the Old Testament"], ["07:16", " is the Word of God. What they were breaking away from was the false teaching of the religious"], ["07:22", " order who had rejected Jesus, the Sanhedrin, the Pharisees, the book of Acts informs"], ["07:28", " us that the Christian Jews were being oppressed and persecuted by their religious leaders."], ["07:34", " The disciples were jailed by the Jewish leaders. So this had a purpose. This helped push"], ["07:41", " them out of Jerusalem so that they would take their newfound faith out to the rest of"], ["07:47", " the world. The early persecution was necessary to push the church out to the world. And"], ["07:52", " we understand this now. But back in 30 AD when it all started, it definitely didn't feel"], ["07:58", " like a good thing. It was a crisis for many of the people. They were losing their homes and"], ["08:05", " communities. It was a social relational crisis. They were losing their livelihood. So was"], ["08:10", " it economic crisis and according to the religious leaders at the temple, they were losing"], ["08:15", " their identity as Jews. So was that identity crisis and the persecution got so bad. It"], ["08:21", " was costing people their very lives. Nero became the emperor of Rome in 54 AD. What does"], ["08:29", " that have to do with anything? Well, Romans typically tried to convert their subjects to"], ["08:34", " their pagan religion when they conquered them. However, in the case of Judaism in Israel,"], ["08:40", " they had a hands off approach. This was due to the fact that the Jewish people were intensely"], ["08:45", " strict in their worship of the one true God. You go to our study through Jeremiah and Daniel"], ["08:51", " and you see why. They had gotten away from the polytheism and worshiping other gods and why"], ["08:56", " they were so intense. They learned their lesson. The Greeks tried to force the Jews to"], ["09:00", " renounce their theological convictions in 167 BC. That resulted in a bloody gruesome Maccabean"], ["09:08", " revolt and the Romans saw no need to make that same mistake. Instead of forcing paganism"], ["09:13", " onto the conquer Jews, they allowed the Judaism to remain the legal religion as long as the"], ["09:18", " Jewish people agreed to pay their taxes to Caesar. So once Christianity began to spread,"], ["09:25", " the question obviously arose quickly, are Christian Jews or not? Are these Christian"], ["09:33", " people? Are they Jews or are they Jews? If they're Jews, then they should be protected"], ["09:38", " under the umbrella of Judaism as a legal religion in the Roman Empire. But if they're not"], ["09:43", " Jews, then they should be viewed as prospective rebels against the Roman rule who need"], ["09:48", " to be converted to paganism or suffer the consequences. And the Jewish religious leaders"], ["09:53", " were telling the Romans, these Christians are not us. Sigma, persecute them. They told"], ["10:00", " lies about the Christians. They said that Christians were cannibals because of our communion,"], ["10:07", " right, where we symbolically eat the bread and drink the wine symbolizing the broken body"], ["10:13", " and blood of Jesus. And they said, \"Ooh, they're eating people in those congregations.\""], ["10:18", " And they also accused the Christians of ancestral relationships because Christians refer"], ["10:23", " to brother and sister and all part of the family of God. They said, \"Hey, they're in"], ["10:31", " bread people.\" And since Christians rejected the false gods of Rome, they were accusing"], ["10:36", " Christians of being atheists. So much like today, lies spoken against the Christians"], ["10:42", " to stir up hate and persecution. And Nero, he was all too eager to oblige. He burnt the"], ["10:49", " city of Rome to the ground and fiddled away and blamed it on the Christians. He was throwing"], ["10:55", " Christians to the lions in the Colosseum for everyone's entertainment. And he was burning"], ["11:00", " Christians alive in his gardens to light his gardens at night. Peter was martyred, Paul"], ["11:07", " was arrested, in 65 AD, things were bad for Christians. Remember, much of the early church"], ["11:15", " are Jews. And in the midst of this persecution, in the midst of all this pain, one starts"], ["11:21", " to wonder, maybe this faith in Jesus wasn't such a good idea. After all, the Jews believe"], ["11:28", " God would bless the righteous. And looking around, couldn't really see any blessings."], ["11:34", " Maybe the Pharisees and the religious leaders are right. Maybe we got it wrong, believing"], ["11:39", " in Jesus just like many of us today, these folks were wondering, where's the supposed good?"], ["11:47", " So that's part of who the author is speaking to, Jewish believers who are doubting their"], ["11:52", " faith. Also, the audience is Jews who have heard about Jesus, who intellectually are convinced,"], ["12:00", " but they're unsure about declaring their faith because it would mean taking a big step"], ["12:05", " and leaving the comfort, the familiarity of Judaism. But it's worth it, the author debates,"], ["12:11", " because Jesus is better, Jesus is greater than everything you're currently holding onto."], ["12:17", " And there is even a tap by the author to convince the Jews who have heard about Jesus,"], ["12:22", " but are unconvinced, trusted him. The message of this book is for them as well as the author"], ["12:27", " explains their old Testament scriptures and reveals that Jesus is, in fact, their God."], ["12:35", " The book of Hebrews helps the Jewish audience understand how to harmonize their new faith"], ["12:39", " in Jesus with their Old Testament roots. The bottom line is, the Jews really didn't understand"], ["12:44", " the Old Testament scriptures. We saw this when we studied Luke. Jesus kept explaining"], ["12:49", " the scriptures in a way that would marvel the audiences, marvel the crowds, and dumb"], ["12:54", " found the religious leaders. So Hebrews is explaining accurately interpreting the Old Testament"], ["13:02", " to the Jewish people. But I think this book is going to be relevant"], ["13:07", " for us today. The people, the recipients of Hebrews, are going through this horrifying season"], ["13:14", " of change. They're experiencing this painful push, and they're so scared of what is in"], ["13:19", " front of them, and we, too, are experiencing the same thing. Through our study of Jeremiah,"], ["13:26", " they prepared us for much of the chaos and confusion that took place over the last four"], ["13:33", " years. Let me make a bold observation, and you can feel free to disagree with me if you'd"], ["13:37", " like. But I personally feel that we were spiritually and emotionally prepared for much"], ["13:44", " of what this nation and the world experience over the last three years because we studied"], ["13:51", " Jeremiah. Think about that. We knew that unless we saw repentance and revival, America"], ["13:58", " was not going to be made great again, just the opposite, and we had been predicting hard"], ["14:04", " times were coming. And man, did they come? But we were spiritually, mentally, philosophically"], ["14:10", " ready for it. So despite many other churches who were struggling and closing, we thrived,"], ["14:17", " we were not overcome by the spirits of fear and hatred that were unleashed upon the land."], ["14:23", " And then for the last two and a half years, while congregations all over the land were tore"], ["14:27", " apart by divisive political rhetoric and deceptive fear-mongering, we just focused on learning"], ["14:37", " the exact truth of who Jesus is, which was so relevant when our political leaders decided"], ["14:43", " to pray blessings of prayers of blessing over the land and the name of false Hindu gods,"], ["14:49", " we boldly proclaim Jesus is Lord. Neither is there salvation in any other. There is no"], ["14:57", " other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. So we have already learned"], ["15:04", " for two and a half years the exact truth of who Jesus is. He is the Messiah. So now we"], ["15:11", " need to learn how much better, how much greater what he's planning is going to be."], ["15:18", " So this book will affirm and strengthen our faith. This book will convince people to believe"], ["15:24", " in Jesus and trust in him. And this book will also warn us to not fall away and reject"], ["15:32", " Jesus. And I think that something believers in 2022 need to hear. We need to know that"], ["15:40", " in the last days there is coming a great reception and a falling away. And Hebrews warns"], ["15:48", " us against that very thing. So I know that I need to deliver this message to the church"], ["15:54", " and to all who join us online in the months to come. And I know this book has messages"], ["16:00", " that our young people need to understand. Listen to me now, we have a lot of new folks"], ["16:06", " that have been joining us here at Faith Bible Church. We've grown by 100 people in the last"], ["16:10", " year. I don't know if you know that, but we've grown by 100 people. And these are families"], ["16:15", " with pre-teens and teens. And we have a lot of people in that 20-something demographic."], ["16:21", " I just want to tell you, you need to park it here for a while so that you and your"], ["16:26", " family can learn these essential truths that is going to deepen our faith. Now I get"], ["16:32", " it. It takes pastor Rob, a long time to get through a book. And if you stick here, you're"], ["16:36", " not going to get a bunch of light, happy, topical messages. I'm sorry. I'm no good at those."], ["16:42", " We did a three-year slugmaster Jeremiah. And likewise Hebrews is meaty and is detailed."], ["16:47", " And most churches would never commit to a two-year. Or however long it's going to take"], ["16:52", " me to get through the book of Hebrews. I'm kind of weird like that. But I'm telling you,"], ["16:56", " there's coming a great deception and a falling away from the faith. And this book has"], ["17:00", " the warnings. This book has the message that will prepare us for what is coming."], ["17:06", " The author boldly declares that Hebrews chapter 4, the Word of God is living and active"], ["17:11", " and sharper than any two-edged sword, penetrating as far as the division of soul and spirit,"], ["17:17", " joint and marrow, and it judges the thoughts and the intense of the heart. And we're going"], ["17:21", " to be able to cut through that deception. We're going to be able to penetrate to the very"], ["17:26", " core of people and discern the thoughts and intents of their hearts, of our own hearts."], ["17:32", " All the distorted thoughts will be dissected. And we will be able to lay aside all the weight"], ["17:39", " in the sin that distracts us so that we can run this challenging marathon of faith that"], ["17:44", " lies before us. We will see others fall by the wayside, but we will understand why. And"], ["17:50", " we will not share in their faith. But rather as the author of Hebrews says in chapter 13"], ["17:54", " verse 21, we will be equipped in every good thing to do his will, working in us what"], ["18:02", " is pleasing in his sights. Just recently in the last six months, I have seen two men pushed"], ["18:12", " into the purging fires of truth, the harsh discipline of the Holy Spirit. And I watched"], ["18:17", " the sword of the Lord be driven into their hearts and reveal their thoughts and intentions."], ["18:23", " I watched one man humble and submit to that painful push. And I watched him come through"], ["18:30", " those purging fires. But as a result, I have seen weights and sins lifted. I have seen impurities"], ["18:38", " purged. And I see gold coming out of this. And I see blessings upon him and his family."], ["18:46", " I watched the other man run from the fire pull away from the sword that was exposing the"], ["18:51", " thoughts and intentions. He did not like the painful push that was compelling him to be equipped"], ["18:56", " for the good will of God. He wanted to do what was pleasing in his sight, not God's. And"], ["19:02", " now there is a crisis of faith for that entire family. And if he hardens his heart, it's"], ["19:07", " not going to end well. But it doesn't have to go down like that. The painful push may hurt."], ["19:12", " The sword cuts us to the core and exposes our sins. But let me show you how much better"], ["19:20", " it will be to press on in faith and not pull back away. We know the exact truth of who"], ["19:26", " Jesus is, the Messiah. Now let's learn how much better Jesus way is. Hebrews chapter"], ["19:34", " one, verse one, if I take your copy of the Word of God. And we will read Hebrews chapter"], ["19:42", " one, verse one, verse word, God. In 65 AD, one may think the author should have qualified"], ["19:56", " God who? After all, the Romans had many gods. The New Testament was written in Greek. The"], ["20:01", "os is the Greek term used here. The Greeks likewise had many gods.

Jews who used to speak Hebrew"], ["22:31", " and the Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew, but now everyone speaks Greek."], ["22:35", " And Jesus spoke Greek. How did the author and the audience understand that term theos? Because"], ["22:43", " when they translated their Hebrew scriptures, the Old Testament over to Greek, so everyone"], ["22:48", " could read them and understand them, they appropriated this term. And we Christians,"], ["22:56", " we too use this term God. And when we do, we're not talking about Hindu or Greek or Muslim"], ["23:03", " gods, we like the Jews are monotheistic. We believe there's only one true God. Theos means"], ["23:11", " the supreme divine. And that's who we're referring to, the one and only deity, the God revealed"], ["23:21", " in this book. Theos is the word used in the Greek Septuagnetes, the Greek Old Testament,"], ["23:28", " where Moses writes in Deuteronomy, \"Here, O Israel, the Lord, our God is one.\" Theos means"], ["23:37", " the supreme divine, the one and only preeminence. The battle was waged in Egypt. Egypt"], ["23:45", " had multiple gods, including their Pharaoh. But Yahweh, I am defeated all the gods of Egypt,"], ["23:53", " and decimated Pharaoh and his army. And Moses asked him at that burning bush, \"Who do"], ["23:58", " I tell the Israelites sent me?\" And God replied and said, \"Tell them Yahweh, I am.\" And"], ["24:05", " that's why this banner series up here is one of my favorites. It's the names of God,"], ["24:10", " the one and only God, and it teaches us of his attributes. This is how he reveals himself"], ["24:17", " what he says about himself.

this guy."], ["22:31", " And I look at three things that he did."], ["22:34", " And I just picked it out here."], ["22:37", " Number one, we can be a good neighbor by showing concern"], ["22:43", "

was the first time in my life that I looked into the eyes of a child and envied them,"], ["00:47", " because she had no idea of what it feels like to doubt."], ["00:51", " What it feels like to have your entire belief system overload with skepticism,"], ["00:58", " to never know the day that you would finally be able to live beyond the shadow of a doubt I've lived in its darkness for so long."],

sleep, the city of my mind is attacked by a legion of questions threatening the living rooms of my sanity and holding them hostage, can you help me?"], ["01:30", " Last year, my grandmother laid in a hospital bed like a bus stop waiting for God to come pick her up."], ["01:41", " I had never seen such pain in such confidence living in the same eyes when she told me, \"I don't know what I'm going to do.\""], ["01:51", " But I know who I belong to and I was so happy for her and something inside of me wished that somehow before she passed away, she could pass down her confidence in God to me like an old family picture."], ["02:06", " I remember sitting in the back row of a cold sanctuary crying because I desperately wanted what the preacher was saying to be true, but my doubts were preaching a sermon of their own and the streams of my tears turned into oceans of frustration."], ["02:25", " I remember sitting in a college classroom and the only thing being tested is my faith in God, the only thing passing is my hope."], ["02:37", " Me, in a back pack full of fear and nowhere to go, no one to help me unpack our sleep."], ["02:48", " I sleep, but I never rest. These lines around my eyes are not wrinkles, they are naps. Let's show you the winding rows that lead to my pain. I'm tired."], ["03:01", " I'm tired. And I'm longing for the day that I can place my fingers in his nail pierced hands because honestly, I've considered quitting but where will I go?"], ["03:13", " Back, there's no home for the living in the land of the dead, so I keep pressing forward."], ["03:20", " Today I have faith, but I can't make any promises about tomorrow.

I'm telling you to consider the blind men who had faith and believed my words before they were even able to see me, consider the birds that eat from my hand and do not fall from the sky without my consent."], ["04:54", " So how much more when I love the ones that I died for before you doubt me, doubt your doubts."], ["05:15", " And you will see they are just as empty as the tomb that I walked from.

I'm there."], ["06:22", " Like when I drown in the red sea of my blood for you and these hands that took holes will hold you. And when I told you that I will love you forever, I'm minted.

You ever struggle to have faith?"], ["07:46", " You want to believe and you want to be strong but what you are going through is beating you down."], ["07:52", " And it is sapping your strength and you are drowning in a sea of doubts."], ["07:58", " You are not alone. You are not alone. And even though you may feel like the only weak minded tiny faith Christian to ever exist, you are not alone."], ["08:11", " As a matter of fact, I think that the church has not been the place it needs to be."], ["08:21", " And I am not talking about just this church. I am talking about the big sea church, like church in general."], ["08:27", " We have failed a lot of the time because this needs to be a place for people who are struggling."], ["08:36", " This needs to be a place for people who have doubts, who have questions."], ["08:43", " But what do we do? I am going to play it out for you."], ["08:48", " Well, how are you doing, brother Mark? I am fine. I am good. Everything is great. How was your week? Great."], ["08:58", " And you know dog on well that you just had a knock down drag out with your spouse in the car."], ["09:06", " Or you know that there are things weighing you down but we are not trained to share that with anybody."], ["09:14", " We are just trained to say I am fine. All good here. And basically we are putting on our church mask is really what we are doing."], ["09:26", " That is not what the church needs to be. Everything in you wants to break down and sob and tell someone that you are sinking."], ["09:35", " But instead you just say I am fine. Or the classic can't complain."], ["09:44", " I will tell you one thing. I sure can. I sure cannot. Maybe I shouldn't."], ["09:50", " But yes, there are things that I am struggling with. It is okay."], ["09:56", " And the church doesn't work the way God designed it to if we are not going to be honest with each other."], ["10:04", " That is just the truth. The church in the way that God set it up and designed it is built around relationships."], ["10:13", " It is built on the rock of Jesus Christ. Yes. But it is built around relationships and doing life together and bearing one another's burdens."], ["10:20", " And if we are not honest with each other, it is just a bunch of people playing a part, playing church."], ["10:29", " And we need everyone here, pastors included, to know that faith Bible church is a place where it is okay to not be okay."], ["10:38", " Where it is okay to come in and to cry and to struggle and to be prayed over and to be lifted up by your brothers and sisters in Christ."], ["10:50", " It is a place where you can come and say, I have addictions, I have issues, I have struggles, I have questions."], ["10:59", " It is not a place where you have to have it all together to enter the doors."], ["11:04", " But a lot of times that is what people think about the church."], ["11:09", " Now, it is okay to not be okay, but it is not where the Lord wants to leave you."], ["11:16", " He doesn't want to leave you in that place. And I want to dive into the topic that a lot of Christians are kind of afraid to talk about and that is doubt."], ["11:25", " It is doubt. We are afraid to approach it because we want everyone to think that we don't doubt."], ["11:34", " That we have such rock-solid faith no matter what happens in our lives. And we trust God all the time perfectly, right? That is what we want people to think of us."], ["11:48", " And I feel that before we explore the topic of doubt, I think we need to define what the term faith is because faith and doubt."], ["11:58", " The juxtaposition, right? So if we want to start in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1, the Bible gives us a definition of faith."], ["12:10", " It says, now, faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."], ["12:18", " In other words, being sure of what we hoped for, being sure of those things that we have not seen, being convinced of what we do not see, convinced."], ["12:31", " Now, I know you guys have been convinced that at one time or other, you knew the words to that song. But yet, you found out, like, oh man, I've been singing those lyrics wrong for 35 years."], ["12:49", " You remember that? You've ever done that? Yes. But being convinced of something that you cannot see. You cannot see it. We cannot touch it. It's just not something we can hold on to with our bare hands."], ["13:05", " But you're convinced of it. That's what faith is. My guess is that none of you have ever seen Jesus in the flesh."], ["13:15", " If you have, let's talk afterwards. Okay? We'll talk afterwards. None of you have seen heaven. None of you were there at His crucifixion."], ["13:29", " None of you were there at His death and burial in His resurrection. None of you saw Jesus Christ resurrected and put your hand, your fingers right into His nail."], ["13:41", " None of you. Now, I know we've got some older folks at the church. We do. You're not that old. Okay?"], ["13:49", " So nobody here in this room has seen God or has seen Jesus to believe those things takes faith. Now, I want to tell you this. I believe that Christianity, if examined, if questioned, is the most defensible, most logical system of belief there is."], ["14:17", " And we should not be scared of questions. We should not be scared to question our faith and to investigate our faith. Sometimes we don't do that because what if I find out something that I, you know, it'll not going to happen."], ["14:33", " If you really, truthfully seek out answers, you will see that Christianity is very logical and very defensible."], ["14:43", " It's not a blind faith, but there is faith involved because we weren't there. We have faith that God exists."], ["14:55", " We have faith that He created this world. We have faith that Jesus existed and that He was who He said He was. We have faith that He died and that He rose again."], ["15:07", " We have faith that He is going to come again and He is going to take His church to heaven to be with Him forever and ever."], ["15:15", " When we talk about having faith in Christ, it's pretty simple. What are you believing? What are you believing for your salvation?"], ["15:25", " Now, as long as I've been pastoring, I've been pastoring 30 years now, wow, I'm old. I can't believe how many people still come in church and they sit down and they get taught every Sunday, the gospel."], ["15:45", " And then when you ask them about what about your salvation, how do you know you're going to heaven? Well, well, because I'm a good person."], ["15:55", " I'm just going to blow it up right now. You're not a good person. I'm not a good person."], ["16:05", " Now, I understand that we are capable of doing good things. I understand that through redemption, God uses us to do His work and we can do good things."], ["16:15", " But in and of ourselves, none of us are good. The Scriptures tell us there is none righteous. No, not one."], ["16:23", " None that seeks God when left to His own devices. Come on, you've got to be honest with yourself when you look at yourself and your desires and your innermost thoughts, not a good person at heart."], ["16:39", " That's a lie of the world like that man is basically good. If that were true, it'd be a whole lot nicer out there. But it's not true. So we say faith in Jesus, it means I'm not trusting in my goodness, I'm trusting in Jesus and what He did for me on the cross for my salvation."], ["17:08", " My complete trust and faith is in Him, meaning if that's not true, I'm in trouble, right? Because I can't do it on my own."], ["17:19", " But so many people, they sit here and they listen and they still have that like I'm a good person thing. It doesn't matter."], ["17:28", " Also, how about this? The fact that, well, all my families Christian, can I tell you something? Let's just chat here."], ["17:40", " There's nobody in the splashing of Kevin."], ["17:45", " Guys, are afraid of me up here. Here's the thing. I don't want to bust any bubble. Yes, I do. I want to bust bubble. Just because your family always came to church doesn't make you a Christian."], ["17:59", " Any more than you sitting in a garage makes you a car. Okay? That's just not the way it works. Like this guy, you know, the sky was struggling with doubt and something. He wishes."], ["18:12", " We saw the faith that his grandmother had. He was like, I wish you could just pass that down to me. Like a family picture and heirloom or something. That doesn't work that way."], ["18:22", " We all have to come to faith in and of ourselves. Like on our own, we have to have our own faith. Okay? And so if you're that kind of person, it's like, well, when I know somebody needs some some talking to about salvation is what I say."], ["18:40", " Well, give your testimony. Well, I've always been a believer. No."], ["18:46", " There had to come a point where you said I believe for myself or I don't. That's just the long and short of it."], ["18:56", " You don't inherit it from your family. The fact that you may have been christened or baptized as an infant. Sorry, you got wet."], ["19:09", " Okay? The thing is, you have to have your own faith when you grow up and you are understanding the scripture like an infant cannot understand anything that's happening."], ["19:23", " When you come to that age when it's different for everybody, but like you come to that age where like I understand what the scripture says, you have to make that choice."], ["19:31", " I'm going to believe it. I'm going to have faith in it or I'm going to reject it."], ["19:36", " That's that's the long and short of it. That's the truth. So are you placing your complete faith in your belief in Jesus Christ that he took away your sin and overcame death and he is the way the truth to life and nobody comes to him except through the father."], ["19:52", " Or somewhere in there is there something about your family or your goodness or you were always a believer or you were christened when you were a bit. None of that. None of that is what makes you a believer."], ["20:07", " Now you might have faith but does that mean that you never have questions or you never have moments or seasons of doubt? Certainly not."], ["20:17", " I mean I have. I have a confession to make as a pastor and I'm about a hundred percent certain that if Pastor Rob were here he would tell you the same thing."], ["20:26", " I have struggled at times in my life with doubts or lack of faith."], ["20:32", " Sometimes it's a fleeting moment. Sometimes it's a season of my life and I've had doubts as to whether or not God is good."], ["20:41", " I've had doubts as to whether or not God had my best interest at heart even though I know Romans 828 says something completely different."], ["20:49", " I've even had doubts as to whether God existed at all."], ["20:57", " But praise God he wasn't done with me yet. And I would like to end stigma surrounding doubts and questions. Everybody goes through it.
